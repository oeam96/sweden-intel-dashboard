      "title": "Considering alternatives to attack on Iran: \"Only Trump knows\"",
      "summary": "US President Donald Trump has been briefed on several possible military options against Iran, ABC News reports citing information. Admiral Brad Cooper, in charge of US forces in the Middle East, presented the options to the president during a meeting at the White House on Thursday. Dan Caine, the US defense chief, also participated, writes the news site.   The briefing took place on the same day that the US and Iran held indirect talks in Geneva on Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The talks ended without an agreement, but Iran said \"technical talks\" will resume in Vienna next week. Israel should strike first Several high-ranking Republicans around the president have suggested in the past week that Israel should strike first, and that the United States should help if necessary. This is what people with insight into the discussions told ABC News. The idea behind the proposal is to avoid the United States appearing as the party that starts a new conflict. Analysts interviewed by ABC News believe the arrangement could also give Republican lawmakers political leeway in an election year, since Trump campaigned on \"ending wars, not starting them.\" At the same time, it is warned that such a strategy risks being perceived as an \"Israel-supported coup\" in the region. \"The media can continue to speculate\" White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly does not want to comment on the information about possible military moves. - The media can continue to speculate about the president's thoughts as much as they want, but only President Trump knows what he will or will not do, says White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly. According to ABC News, it was still unclear Thursday whether Trump, who their sources say is growing increasingly frustrated with Iran's refusal to accede to his demands to halt uranium enrichment and limit its ballistic missile program, has actually adopted any of the proposed plans.",
      "title_original": "Överväger alternativ till attack mot Iran: ”Bara Trump vet”",
      "summary_original": "USA:s president Donald Trump har briefats om flera möjliga militära alternativ mot Iran, uppger ABC News med hänvisning till uppgifter. Amiral Brad Cooper, ansvarig för amerikanska styrkor i Mellanöstern, lade fram alternativen för presidenten under ett möte i Vita huset på torsdagen. Även Dan Caine, USA:s försvarschef, deltog, skriver nyhetssajten.   Briefingen ägde rum samma dag som USA och Iran höll indirekta samtal i Genève om Irans kärnvapen- och ballistiska missilprogram. Samtalen slutade utan överenskommelse, men Iran uppgav att ”tekniska samtal” ska återupptas i Wien nästa vecka. Israel ska slå först Flera högt uppsatta republikaner runt presidenten har den senaste veckan föreslagit att Israel ska slå till först, och att USA vid behov ska hjälpa till. Det säger personer med insyn i diskussionerna till ABC News. Tanken bakom förslaget är att undvika att USA framstår som den part som startar en ny konflikt. Analytiker som intervjuats av ABC News menar att upplägget även skulle kunna ge republikanska lagstiftare politiskt utrymme i ett valår, eftersom Trump kampanjat på att ”avsluta krigen, inte starta dem”. Samtidigt varnas för att en sådan strategi riskerar att uppfattas som en ”Israelstödd kupp” i regionen. ”Media kan fortsätta spekulera” Vita husets biträdande pressekreterare Anna Kelly vill inte kommentera uppgifterna om möjliga militära drag. – Media kan fortsätta spekulera om presidentens tankar hur mycket de vill, men bara president Trump vet vad han kommer att göra eller inte göra, säger Vita husets biträdande pressekreterare Anna Kelly. Enligt ABC News var det på torsdagen fortfarande oklart om Trump, som enligt deras källor uppges bli alltmer frustrerad över att Iran vägrar gå med på hans krav om att stoppa urananrikningen och begränsa sitt ballistiska missilprogram, faktiskt har antagit någon av de föreslagna planerna.",
