      "title": "Busch increases the most in new measurement – ​​keys in on Åkesson",
      "summary": "In the survey for February 2026, Magdalena Andersson (S) continued to have the highest level of trust with 43 percent. Ulf Kristersson (M) follows with 36 percent, then Jimmie Åkesson (SD) on 29 percent and Ebba Busch (KD) on 28 percent.  The distance between Andersson and Kristersson is still statistically secure - but is shrinking compared to January. Confidence in Kristersson increases somewhat and he is now statistically assured ahead of Åkesson.  Ebba Busch increases the most The largest increase is accounted for by Ebba Busch. Her confidence rises statistically by 4 percentage points, from 24 to 28 percent, which means that she is now only one percentage point behind Åkesson. \n \nIn the bottom segment, a slight rise can be seen for Elisabeth Thand Ringqvist (C) and Simona Mohamsson (L), who both increase by 2 percentage points. Mistrust is changing In the same survey, mistrust towards Ulf Kristersson drops significantly by 6 percentage points, from 46 to 40 percent. Distrust of Jimmie Åkesson increases by 5 percentage points, from 54 to 59 percent. \n\nFor Elisabeth Thand Ringqvist, mistrust increases by 5 percentage points, from 35 to 40 percent, even though trust is rising at the same time. \n\nNovus also points to the fact that Ebba Busch received a lot of international attention, including in Davos and in connection with a Gripen campaign in Canada. At the same time, the Christian Democrats lost in Novus' latest voter barometer and ended up under the Riksdag barrier.",

      "summary_original": "I mätningen för februari 2026 har Magdalena Andersson (S) fortsatt högst förtroende med 43 procent. Ulf Kristersson (M) följer med 36 procent, därefter Jimmie Åkesson (SD) på 29 procent och Ebba Busch (KD) på 28 procent.  Avståndet mellan Andersson och Kristersson är fortfarande statistiskt säkerställt – men krymper jämfört med januari. Förtroendet för Kristersson ökar något och han är nu statistiskt säkerställt före Åkesson.  Ebba Busch ökar mest  Den största ökningen står Ebba Busch för. Hennes förtroende stiger statistiskt säkerställt med 4 procentenheter, från 24 till 28 procent, vilket gör att hon nu bara är en procentenhet efter Åkesson. \n \nI bottensegmentet syns en svag uppgång för Elisabeth Thand Ringqvist (C) och Simona Mohamsson (L), som båda ökar med 2 procentenheter. Misstroendet förändras  I samma mätning minskar misstroendet mot Ulf Kristersson markant med 6 procentenheter, från 46 till 40 procent. Misstroendet mot Jimmie Åkesson ökar med 5 procentenheter, från 54 till 59 procent. \n\nFör Elisabeth Thand Ringqvist ökar misstroendet med 5 procentenheter, från 35 till 40 procent, trots att förtroendet samtidigt stiger. \n\nNovus pekar också på att Ebba Busch fått stor internationell uppmärksamhet, bland annat i Davos och i samband med en Gripen-kampanj i Kanada. Samtidigt tappade Kristdemokraterna i Novus senaste väljarbarometer och hamnade under riksdagsspärren.",
