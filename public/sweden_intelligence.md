## The lawyer's threat - send criminal clients on the ex-girlfriend
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-13 (today)

During the summer and autumn of last year, a lawyer in Dalarna allegedly committed several serious crimes against his former girlfriend. According to the indictment, the man, who is in his 40s, secretly filmed, threatened with a knife and abused her. And when the lawyer understood that she was about to report him, he allegedly used his position to intimidate her into silence. According to the indictment, he threatened the girlfriend to send a former client on her. The woman testifies that he says his clients will do "anything" for him, gave her the name of a convicted felon and threatened to have a "quick talk" with her. Recorded the conversation The lawyer also threatened to counter-report the woman for rape if she went ahead with a police report, something she recorded with the phone: "You say you're going to report me for rape," she says in the recording. "Yes, I will have to," he replies. When asked why he needs it, he replies that he has to "protect himself". "Okay, so you protect yourself. There's no reason to report anyone, is it? Unless I've done it." "That's how it works." The woman tells in questioning that she feels afraid of him and gets heart palpitations when she hears his voice after the events. Denies crime The lawyer is now charged with gross breach of the peace, which includes the violent crimes, and assault in court proceedings. He denies any crime, and believes that the bruises she says occurred during an assault are due to her "stumbling into things". Last fall, the man received a warning and a fine of SEK 250,000 from the Bar Association after appearing under the influence in the district court, according to Falu-Kuriren. In addition, he was convicted of aggravated drunken driving twice in one year.

## The Western alliance is being tested in Munich - will be a thriller
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-13 (today)

Outside the luxury hotel Bayerischer Hof in central Munich, there are small lit candles, flowers and dozens of pictures of the "king of pop" - Michael Jackson. It was when he died that a statue in a park outside the hotel became a pilgrimage site for grieving fans.  In a bizarre dispute over the years, two rival gangs of Jackson lovers emerged who claimed the makeshift monument as theirs. They tore down each other's tributes in nocturnal raids. But for the next few days, the Jackson gang will be allowed to continue their rivalry out of sight. The monument is located within the security zone for the annual security conference in Munich. Kristersson and three ministers on site Prime Minister Kristersson is coming from Sweden with three ministers. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is there, of course, along with around 60 other leaders, such as Ukraine's Zelensky. That J.D. Vance not attending has raised many questions. Does that mean the Trump administration has decided to lower the temperature?  Extending a "We Are the World"-like olive branch to European leaders? Or will Secretary of State Marco Rubio give an equally confrontational speech? The so-called peace plan for Ukraine will be discussed. The so-called cease-fire in Gaza will be dissected. The so-called arrest of Venezuela's Maduro will be criticized, at least somewhat quietly, and the so-called negotiations on the future of Greenland will be high on the agenda. A circus even outside the hotel Outside the congress, we can expect a Jackson-like circus. Hundreds of thousands of exiled Iranians are expected to demonstrate Saturday against the country's rule, and the son of Iran's last shah will speak.  Thousands of Ukrainians – as well as opponents of continued support for Ukraine – will also be out in the streets. Around 5,000 police officers are on site. But above all, all numbers will be analyzed down to the smallest detail. Will this be another nail in the coffin for the Western alliance? Or it gets a respite after some tough ones

## Anger at Trump's climate decision: "He has appointed the judges"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-13 (today)

The climate regulations that were introduced during Barack Obama's time as president are being dismantled.  The rules established that greenhouse gases pose a threat to public health and gave the state the right to limit emissions from, among other things, cars and oil and gas operations.  The decision has drawn sharp criticism - not least from Obama himself. "We will be less safe, less healthy and less capable of combating climate change - all so that the fossil fuel industry can make even more money," writes the former president on X.

## The expert on the verdict: End of the "wild west" for influencers
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-12 (today)

Youtuber Pontus Rasmusson had unreported income of almost 2.3 million in 2020 and 2021. On Thursday, he was sentenced to prison for serious accounting offenses against his denial, which TV4 Nyheterna reported on. Emanuel Karlsten, journalist and chairman of the Media Academy, believes that the verdict can have several positive effects. - This may put an end to the circus that has been. By the "circus" he refers to the influencer market on platforms such as YouTube and Tiktok, where content creators have made a lot of money on, what it seemed, completely their own terms. "The Internet is not a total free zone" Karlsten believes that this sentence, together with the sentence against Christofer "Crippa" Lundström, can help set the boundaries in the YouTube world. - These are two examples of how the internet is not a total free zone, but an arena where influencers must play by the same rules as everyone else. He believes that the judges will become warning examples for future content creators. - There will surely be more judgments of this type. The influencer market has been the wild west for a long time. It may be easy to believe that you live in a parallel universe with an audience of millions, but you live in the real world. - Now there will be a reference. In both Pontus and Chrippa's case, it has been a matter of a lack of basic accounting skills. It will be easier to refer to these two judgments in the future. "Not a world for him" Furthermore, Emanuel Karlsten believes that the verdict is positive for Pontus Rasmusson personally. - It is obvious that this is not a world for him. He hasn't been able to handle it. He made sexualized content for his child audience, an obvious misstep. Then he doesn't get his basic paperwork in order and is now in prison. TV4 Nyheterna has contacted Pontus Rasmusson and his lawyer Tomas Malm for a comment.

## Discovered the cancer too late: "I thought it was the menopause"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-12 (today)

Over the past decade, the number of colon cancer cases has increased, especially in the 50-59 age group. The EU now recommends that member states offer screening from the age of 50, but in Sweden the starting age is still 60. The National Board of Health and Welfare justifies its decision by saying that there is a lack of sufficient scientific evidence that screening between the ages of 50 and 59 would reduce mortality, and that there is a lack of staff and the risk of unequal care. - We don't understand how the National Board of Health and Welfare has thought here, says Birger Pålsson, docent and chief physician. He participated in the National Board of Health and Welfare's expert group that recommended starting screening at the age of 50. He estimates that between 50 and 100 people in the age group 50–59 per year could be saved if screening were introduced earlier. - What we have criticized very harshly is that there is a large amount of international scientific reports that unanimously show this. The National Board of Health and Welfare has not reviewed the modern scientific literature. We were only tasked with reviewing four articles and they are a little old at this point. But paradoxically, most of them also recommend starting at age 50, says Pålsson. Spotted a lump Lotta Hammar was diagnosed at the age of 53, by which time the cancer had already spread. She says that the symptoms were unclear and that she first suspected menopause. - I thought: I'm tired, it's menopause. I'm getting rounder, it's menopause. I blamed it all on: It must be the menopause. It wasn't in my world that it would be something, she says in Efter fem. It wasn't until she discovered a lump the size of a tennis ball sticking out of the left side of her stomach that she checked it out. By then she had been suffering from fatigue and other symptoms for a year. - It had gone so far that I had colon cancer that had spread metastases. So it had gone way too far. When she got the cancer news, she didn't believe it at first. The hardest part of all was telling her children. - They

## See the incredible pictures - a mile out on the ice: "Fantastic natural phenomenon"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-12 (today)

The ice has been thick on Kvarken along the Finnish coast for a long time. So thick that Ylva von Wright and a friend took on a challenge: to get as close to Sweden as possible on cross-country skates. - We guessed that we would come across a chute with open water, but we wanted to see how far we could go, says Ylva von Wright to TV4 Nyheterna. Ylva and the friend, who are studying to become wilderness guides, had time to get about eight kilometers out on the water before they started to encounter ice banks. The first embankment was still, but a couple of hundred meters out they heard the sound of embankments moving. - We got to experience a fantastic natural phenomenon. What I like about the ice that makes it so fascinating is that you can never plan anything ahead of time because the conditions can change so quickly. "Risk of being separated from land" According to SMHI, ice dams can form when the ice is pressed against land or other larger blocks of ice. For this, however, it is required that the ice is thicker than 15-20 centimeters.  The flakes that form the dykes are not usually frozen together, and Ylva and her friend became aware of this when the ice began to crack a little further out. Even the innermost dike began to move over time. - There was a risk that we would end up on an ice floe and be separated from the coast, so it was best to turn around. You must be aware of the risks and respect nature when you go out on the ice. However, they never felt any direct concern. - Since we were in the archipelago, we were quite close to islands, so it didn't feel like we were that far out, says Ylva von Wright. Had food for two days Since the plan was to get as close to the Swedish coast as possible, Ylva von Wright and her friend had really tickled themselves. In addition to the usual equipment of ice spikes, throwing line and dry clothes packed in waterproof sacks, they carried food for two days and four liters of water each. Did you think you would reach Sweden? - No, it was more of a fun idea. You would have needed a packraft to get over the chute. At certain times of the day you can cross the gutter

## Dolph on the tough times with the family: "Met a few times a year"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-12 (today)

Swedish child rearing is the theme of this week's episode of "Skavlan & Sweden". Guests included the karate master, civil engineer and action hero Dolph Lundgren and his younger daughter Greta. They both describe that Dolph Lundgren was a very absent family man.  - We only saw each other once a year, says Greta Lundgren in the program. Dolph Lundgren says that when he lived in Marbella, he was away for about six months a year and shot three movies to pay for the luxurious lifestyle. He tried to compensate by sending them money and taking them on vacations on a yacht or in the Mediterranean. He says that he often felt misunderstood as to why he was so absent. - They didn't understand how tough it was trying to support the family, how expensive everything is and how hard it is to make an action film.  - But at the same time, they probably miss that they didn't really know their father, says Dolph Lundgren. The daughter: "He had his own demons" Greta Lundgren grew up in Spain with her mother and older sister Ida and felt very abandoned as a child. Now, when Greta is older, she can understand the choices her father made. - I understand that he needed to do that and I think he had his own demons. He needed to be away working. It was good for him. He probably knew it wasn't good that he was with us every day. He wanted to spare us from that, so he stayed away.  When Dolph Lundgren started going to therapy as a 50-year-old, he decided to repair the relationship with his two daughters and apologize for how absent he had been. - It was when I was around 50 myself that I started to come to grips with my own trauma from my childhood. It reflects on how I behaved in life. I had a very tough upbringing with my father who was very violent towards me, he says. New wife the same age as daughter Greta Lundgren says that it felt very strange at first when her father got a new wife who was the same age as Greta's older sister I

## That's why the cold bites - despite global warming
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-12 (today)

In large parts of northern Europe and North America, January this year has been colder than normal. In Sweden, temperature deficits were noted throughout the country, especially in the northern parts, where in places it was down to eight degrees colder than normal.  - You must also distinguish between weather and climate. We have cold weather right now. But the climate is warmer and is warming up, says meteorologist Peter Kondrup. Jet streams are affected by climate change At the same time as the cold has taken hold in Sweden, South America and Australia have been affected by heat waves and fires. Peter Kondrup explains that the jet streams, which normally move across the Northern Hemisphere, have become slower and more elongated because the polar regions are warming faster than the equator. This leads to larger and slower oscillations, which can produce both colder and warmer periods than normal.  - There can be very large but slow, tough swings. It is an effect of climate change, of global warming. "We have a bad memory" The past twelve years have been the warmest globally, and 2025 was the third warmest year to date. Although this year's January is perceived as cold, it is a mild winter in a longer historical perspective.  - We experience January 2026 as very cold, but compare it to the war winters of the 1940s, then it appears as a pale copy. It was really cold then. Or in the 80s.  For the past 20 years, we have experienced unusually mild winters in Sweden, which may have made us forget how cold it can actually be in winter. - We feel that it is cold and it is a little colder than it has been in a few years. Our memory is quite short. We've gotten used to this global warming, and when it gets a little colder than normal, we think it's freezing cold, says Peter Kondrup.

## Took food waste home and got fired - now Marie gets compensation
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-12 (today)

Marie Hansson had worked as a cook in a special accommodation for 17 years when she was suddenly called to a meeting with the manager. There she was accused of theft because she had brought food waste home - and was fired.  - I was completely speechless and thought it was a joke. It came out of nowhere, I hadn't even been told.  Marie enjoyed her work very well and describes it as a shock when the news came - two days before her 50th birthday.  - I decided then and there that it wasn't right. You shouldn't behave that way. Sued the employer Marie sued her employer Skurup Municipality a year and a half ago. Her representative Bo Villner believes that the employer's action was disproportionate and believes that there were other solutions to the situation.  - Our opinion is that it is a trivial incident. There's no reason to believe she wouldn't have stopped if only she had been asked. Why an employer chooses to do so is difficult to know, he believes.  - It can be due to several things. You can have prestige behind it or you dislike someone and want to get rid of them. But this is a bit like cracking nuts with a sledgehammer.  To Sydsvenskan, Egil Ceylan, head of office at Skurup's municipality, informs that he cannot comment on the individual case.  "Standing up for myself" Marie Hansson has received a lot of support after the incident.  - Both from acquaintances and strangers, everyone says it was well done and gives me a pat on the back. To this day, Marie has not received any explanation as to why she was not given a warning or notice. - If they had told me to stop it, of course I would have done it. Now she hopes her case can help others in similar situations. - I stand up for myself and maybe this can support someone else too. You have to have the courage to speak up when things don't go right.

## Here the record rocket takes off
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-12 (today)

The launch took place from Europe's space base in French Guiana at 17:45 Swedish time. It is the sixth flight of Ariane 6, but the first with four boosters – a configuration known as Ariane 64. The rocket can now lift about 21.6 tonnes into low orbit, more than double that of previous versions.  The goal of today's launch is to place 32 satellites into orbit, as part of Amazon's rollout of a satellite-based internet system.  European competitiveness in space Ariane 6 is developed to give Europe independent and competitive access to space, the Swedish Space Agency writes on its blog. The version has a longer nose cone than before and is the largest Ariane 6 to date. The rocket is 62 meters, equivalent to a high-rise building with 20 floors. The increased capacity means that larger and heavier loads can be launched at the same time, which is crucial when the number of satellites in orbit is rapidly increasing. Clear Swedish contributions Sweden contributes to the Ariane 6 program via the European Space Agency ESA.  The company GKN Aerospace in Trollhättan develops and manufactures, among other things, nozzles and turbines for the rocket's engines.  "The launch marks an important step for Europe's space transport and shows how European cooperation, with contributions from several countries, strengthens Europe's ability to reach and use space," writes the Swedish Space Agency.

**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-12 (today)

Philip Denié Dahl Petersen is sentenced to prison indefinitely for a knife murder and an attempted murder in the summer of 2022. In the middle of the night last Wednesday, the 37-year-old escaped from Vestre prison in Copenhagen. Since then, an extensive police operation has been underway in Denmark. Heavily armed "special police" have taken part in the hunt, according to Danish media. The public has also been urged to be extra vigilant.

## Hundreds on site when murdered My was buried
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-12 (today)

My, 25, disappeared the night before Boxing Day and was found murdered the following day. On Thursday afternoon, she was buried in the Oscar church in Stockholm. My's family decided to make the funeral open to the public because the murder received so much attention. Rönning resident Patrik Fransson has made it to Stockholm to attend. - I feel that I want to be here to show respect for the family, he says. He hopes that the funeral will be an opportunity for people to come together. - I see quite a lot of hatred and strong emotions. I think it is good that people can come into contact with each other and share feelings together and unite in love, he says. "Hope they can move on" Delmon Haffo, a moderate municipal politician in Salem, is also present, but more as a concerned Rönningebo than as a politician, he says.

- For me, it is very important to show support to the family and everyone involved and to show that society is behind them, he says. He didn't know My personally, but knew who she was. They had several mutual friends. - I am above all here because I was touched by something incredible that this could happen in Rönninge, he says. - I hope it will be a nice end to the family's grief work. I hope that they get the opportunity to move on and that we get a church filled with love. The family's statement: "The loss is bottomless" My's family does not want to talk to the press in connection with the funeral, but yesterday they shared this statement: We want to thank everyone who has shown us warmth, care and support. It means a lot to us. Our beloved daughter, My, loved sunsets, seas and open horizons. She was curious and brave and stood firm in her convictions, with an obvious respect for others. My spoke more about the world than about herself and never gave up on what she believed in. My was quick-thinking and full of life, with a special ability to capture moments – in pictures, on film and in meetings with people. She saw the vividness in every situation and spread joy about SEK

## Pontus Rasmusson is sentenced to prison
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-12 (today)

The judgment concerns deficiencies in the accounting during the years 2020 and 2021. Pontus Rasmusson then had unreported income of almost SEK 2.3 million.  The investigation has shown that he kept the accounts on paper instead of using an accounting program. During the trial, he has emphasized that he was young and inexperienced. He has also said that during that period he had to endure a lot of hate and threats and that he then prioritized YouTube over his accounting. But the court states that he was aware that he was running a business subject to bookkeeping and that he was completely indifferent to whether the bookkeeping met the requirements.  Commenting himself Pontus Rasmusson denies any crime. On Snapchat, he writes that the district court chose not to see all the evidence. He also writes that he has read the majority of similar judges where "the outcome has been completely different" "An unpunished person should not be assessed with the harshest punishment on the punishment scale" he also writes and thinks that he has now "learned". The channel was shut down He was also charged with complicating tax control. The court considers that it is a crime that should be included in one of the accounting crimes.  27-year-old Rasmusson was previously one of Sweden's biggest YouTubers aimed at children, but in 2022 his channel was shut down. According to Google, he had violated the child safety policy, which prohibits content that sexualizes minors. In addition to two cases of serious accounting offences, he is convicted of complicating tax control. He is also sentenced to pay SEK 50,000 in corporate fines.

## Annelie was found dead in the lake - Juha Marttila, 56, is convicted of murder
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-12 (today)

The family understood that something was wrong when 46-year-old Annelie Nevborn Eriksson had not heard from her children after she disappeared from her home on December 6, 2024. The next day, her brother Andreas Törnkvist reported her missing. A large search effort was launched, Missing People was called in and over 200 people volunteered to participate in the search. Three months after she disappeared, she was found dead in a lake, wrapped in a blanket in a garbage bag - at the same time her 56-year-old Juha Marttila was arrested. Today he was sentenced to 18 years in prison for murder and violation of grave peace. - The district court has, after an examination of a series of circumstantial evidence, concluded that it is beyond reasonable doubt that the man killed the woman and then moved the body in the way that the prosecutor has claimed. Other perpetrators can be excluded, says court president Anne Olsson.  Got an early tip about the roommate In the investigation, it appears that the police had been keeping an eye on Juha Marttila for some time. Relatives had stated that they got a strange feeling when they talked to him. Missing People also alerted the police to Juha Marttila. After searching for a week, they advised the police that they wanted to do an internal search. Then he had contacted an acquaintance to move furniture in the home. The partner must also have stated that they had recently broken up. "Missing People got bad vibes from this. First, that they had broken up just before the disappearance, but also that he was so careful to move under furniture right after Missing People's phone call," writes the police who received the tip.  Had similar garbage bags at home The same kind of garbage bags that she was found in were also found in Juha Marttila's residence. The fibers that were in the blanket were also found in his car and on thresholds in the home.  The prosecutor said that they had extensive technical evidence and that several interrogations pointed to Juha Marttila as having committed the murder. He had strangled her to death and then moved the body and left it in the lake. Juha Marttila has always denied it

## US used mysterious superweapon against cartel drones
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-12 (today)

On Wednesday, the US aviation authority FAA closed the airspace over the city of El Paso on the border with Mexico in southern Texas in the US.  The shutdown, which lasted a total of seven hours, meant, among other things, that no planes could take off from the international airport in the city. The reason behind the shutdown is that drones belonging to Mexican drug cartels have crossed the border, says US Transport Minister Sean Duffy on X. Used super weapon The US responded by resorting to a weapon they had never used before, reports the Reuters news agency. According to sources with insight, it is a kind of anti-drone weapon with direct energy technology - i.e. the same type of technology that the US is suspected of having used in connection with the strike against Venezuela's now deposed President Nicolás Maduro. Neither the Pentagon nor AeroVironment, the company behind the drone, have commented on the data. When the information about the drone came from Mexico, the FAA initially said that the airport in El Paso would remain closed for up to ten days.  Delayed Valentine's Day trip Two people affected by the stop were Jorge Rueda and Yamilexi Meza who were scheduled to fly to Portland, Oregon for a Valentine's Day trip. - I am happy that ten days became only two hours for us, Jorge Rueda told AP after their flight was rebooked. According to documents from the Pentagon, over a thousand drone observations are made a month on the border with Mexico. According to Reuters, the authorities are working on dealing with these, especially around airports and large events.

## Finland vaccinates Russian rabies foxes: "Don't touch"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-12 (1 day old)

Foul-smelling packages have been placed along Finland's eastern border to stop rabies from entering the country. The packages contain fish-scented baits with vaccines, specially formulated for wild predators such as foxes and raccoons. The background is reports of rabies cases in the Moscow region of Russia. Despite that, the situation is calm, according to the experts. - Bait vaccines have been distributed every year since the early 1990s. It is a proven and effective method to prevent the spread of rabies, says Tiina Nokireki, senior researcher at the Swedish Food Agency, to the Finnish Ilta Sanomat.  Rabies-free for 30 years Finland has been classified as rabies-free for around 30 years. The vaccines are being distributed across the southeastern border, which is considered the most likely route for the infection to enter from Russia. Last fall, around 180,000 vaccine doses were released in the area. But despite the outbreak in Moscow, the risk has not increased, emphasizes Nokireki. - Vaccines have also been distributed on the Russian side, and besides, the distance is long. Animals don't move such long distances, she tells the newspaper. Do not touch the baits - vaccinate your pets The vaccine baits smell really bad and should be left alone. If humans touch them, animals may avoid them due to human weathering. It is also not advisable to come into contact with the vaccine solution inside the bait. At the same time, the authorities remind us of the importance of vaccinating pets. - Dogs and cats should be vaccinated against rabies throughout the country, says Nokireki. Should rabies still reach Finland, it is more likely that the infection will first spread to pets and then on to humans - rather than humans being infected directly by wild animals, according to the Finnish Food Agency.

## Here are the counties with the highest and lowest unemployment rates
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-12 (1 day old)

At the end of January, 363,000 people were registered as unemployed at the Employment Agency. The percentage of unemployed has decreased to 6.8 percent at the end of January compared to 7.2 percent a year ago, according to the statistics.  Compared to previous months, however, there is a marginal increase in the number of unemployed. - We often see a certain increase around the turn of the year, so that figure is no surprise. If we take seasonal patterns into account, we instead see a continued reduction in unemployment, and that for the sixth month in a row, says Eva Samakovlis, director of analysis at Arbetsförmedlingen. That county is the best Norrbotten county has the country's lowest unemployment (3.9 percent). Skåne and Södermanland's counties are in the second bracket, with unemployment rates of 8.9 and 8.5 percent respectively. Youth unemployment is also decreasing. In total, roughly 40,000 young people aged 18 to 24 were registered with the Employment Service at the end of January. This is a decrease of just over 4,000 compared to the same period last year. At the same time as the percentage of the unemployed is decreasing, the Swedish Employment Agency sees an increase in the long-term unemployed. The number of registered people who had been unemployed for twelve months or longer was roughly 153,000 in January, an increase of almost 2,000 people from January the previous year.
