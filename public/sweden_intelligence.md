## Over a million exiled Iranians demonstrated
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-15 (today)

On Saturday, more than a million exiled Iranians rallied in cities around the world in support of the Iranian people after the ousted Shah's son Reza Pahlavi called for a "global day of action" with a particular focus on Munich, Toronto and Los Angeles. In Munich, where the annual security conference was taking place in parallel, German police said around 250,000 people took part in the demonstration. Reza Pahlavi himself attended the security conference and spoke, among other things, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. 

Pahlavi also attended the demonstration where he gave a speech. - We tell all grieving families that they are not alone. As a child, father, husband and brother, I understand the pain of the grieving families. Not a day has passed without me shedding tears, but these tears give me energy, he told the large crowd at the venue. US Senator Lindsey Graham also spoke at the demonstration and expressed support for the Iranian people's struggle for democracy. 

- Help is on the way, he said during his speech. An estimated 350,000 people gathered in Toronto and about the same number attended in Los Angeles. In Britain, police reported that 50,000 people took part in the demonstrations. The participants chanted slogans against the Iranian regime and expressed support for the relatives of the thousands of people killed during the protests in Iran more than a month ago.

Thousands also gathered in Stockholm and Gothenburg to demonstrate against the Iranian regime.

## Hope for babies: New weapon against RS virus
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-15 (today)

Every season, an average of 1,650 children over the course of a year need hospital care due to RS virus infection. In a country with good healthcare, it is not a fatal disease, but worried parents come to the children's emergency room with babies who have difficulty breathing when the cough, fever and phlegm hit. Small children's airways are more seriously affected by the RS virus, so they may need breathing support in the form of oxygen. When small children get sick with a high fever, they may find it difficult to eat, and then they get a tube down their stomach with nutrition, says Susanne Strömdahl, infectious disease doctor and investigator at the Norwegian Public Health Agency. The very youngest children, who are only a few months old, can sometimes suffer from breathing pauses, so-called apneas. Hope for a turning point Now there is hope for a turning point, which could lead to a significantly reduced burden on children's healthcare during the winter months - and reduced suffering for the very smallest. Since September 10 last year, newborns are offered an injection with antibodies against the RS virus. A majority of parents have agreed. It is not surprising, but it is very gratifying that the majority choose to accept with the big win for the smallest children to be protected for the first winter season. Is it revolutionary? Yes, it is based on the international data we see reported, says Susanne Strömdahl. Not one hundred percent. She describes the medicine as safe. So far, there have been five reports of side effects in Sweden, and in those cases it has mainly been a fine dotted rash or redness and swelling at the injection site. The antibodies provide good, but not 100% protection against serious illness. After the treatment began to be offered, the Public Health Agency has only received reports of a few children who received antibodies and still suffered RS virus infection. We expect a large protective effect. But in this situation, we are just at the beginning of the spread of infection. We had the start of the season in week five. The advice to protect babies from meeting cold people outside is approached

## Demands a ban on private fireworks: Risks death
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-15 (today)

When the calendar has now moved to February, the New Year's Eve fireworks have died down, but the debate about whether or not fireworks should be used continues. Are they a natural part of the festive season or do they just cause unnecessary suffering to animals and people? On February 17, the defense committee will consider several received motions concerning bans or restrictions on fireworks. Before that, 13 organizations have come together and written an open letter urging the committee to take the motions seriously and consider a total ban on fireworks for private individuals.  Can suffer lifelong hearing damage The letter has been signed by several animal welfare organizations, but also by blue light personnel, including the Swedish Police Association.

- Today, we mainly have hearing damage that is sometimes lifelong and that you can't do anything about. We don't have, pepper pepper, no cops that have had any of these pyrotechnics in the face or anything like that. But on the day it happens, considering how potent these fireworks are, we run the risk of even worse injuries or death, says Björn Johnsson, regional head security representative of the Swedish Police Association. In a survey among the members of the Police Association, 13 percent of police officers on external duty answered that they had been fired upon with fireworks. The industry does not believe that bans solve problems The industry does not believe that a ban would have solved this type of problem. 

- It would have reduced some ordinary fireworks and not least it would have reduced for those who are law abiding and already behave themselves. On the other hand, the rather large part of illegal fireworks imports had certainly increased. It's already big and it wouldn't disappear, unfortunately, says Martin Hildeberg, treasurer of Sweden's Pyrotechnic Industry Association.

But Björn Johnsson of the Swedish Police Association does not agree that a ban would mainly affect the law-abiding.

- I think we have passed that stage. About 13 percent of our police officers feel that this is a problem and ambulance and rescue personnel

## Obama after Trump's monkey clip: There seems to be no shame
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-15 (today)

It was in early February that Trump posted the AI-generated video in which Barack and Michelle Obama were depicted as monkeys - something that was met with fierce criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. The White House blamed the release of the video on a staff member, and it was deleted after a while. In a podcast, Obama is asked to comment on US discourse, and host Brian Tyler Cohen brings up the monkey video. It is important to remember that a majority of the American population finds this behavior deeply troubling, Obama said in the podcast, according to the BBC. He also says that it is a kind of "clown show" that takes place on social media and on television. There seems to be no shame in this among people who used to feel they had to have some sort of decency.

## CIA manual from World War II goes viral in the US
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-14 (today)

The text was written during World War II by William "Wild Bill" Donovan, head of the Office of Strategic Services which later became the CIA. The manual was published in 2008. In the last month, it has been downloaded nearly 60,000 times and is now the fifth most popular e-book on Project Gutenberg, an American literature project that works to make available literature that is not covered by copyright. Small actions slow down the system The manual describes so-called "simple sabotage". It is about everyday behaviors that, if repeated, can make it difficult for a bureaucracy to function. Among the advice is to: Give long speeches and drag out meetings.  Bring up side issues and discuss details unnecessarily.  "Misunderstanding" instructions, asking many questions and delaying answers. It is also suggested to play dumb, be as annoying and argumentative as possible without breaking rules, as well as to stop talking when representatives of the regime enter a room. The purpose, according to the authors, is to make the work of the police and security services more difficult, but also to give ordinary people a way to show resistance to decisions they perceive as unacceptable. Attention in today's USA Why the manual has gone viral right now is unclear. According to the online newspaper 404 Media, the interest coincides with a period of unrest and change in the American workplace, especially among government employees. Questions of loyalty, reorganizations and new demands on employees have become more common in a more polarized political climate. During Donald Trump's time in power, discussions about the role of the state and the independence of the authorities have again taken place in the public debate. In that context, the old CIA manual has received new attention among some readers. On a large online forum for government employees, one of the most-read posts is headlined: "To my colleagues, especially veterans: we are at war." There, the manual is shared primarily as a historical document – ​​and as a basis for discussion.

## Saga Ludvigsson and Medina straight to the final in Mello
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-14 (today)

Saga Ludvigsson makes it to the final with the country pop song "Ain't today". The 20-year-old from Örby in Västergötland promised more energy after Friday's rehearsal and now it is clear that her contribution has gone home with the viewers. She debuted with the contribution "Hate you so much" last year, won her preliminary competition and finished in twelfth and last place in the final. This year, Ludvigsson describes his contribution as a little more cocky, more mature and darker. Favorite love song Hip-hop duo Medina predicted their chances as good with the contribution "Viva l'amor" on Valentine's Day. It also went down well with the audience, the contribution received the most votes. Made up of veterans Sami Rekik and Ali Jammali, Medina were favorites from the start. The duo has previously come in third and second place in the Melodifestivalen and has stated during the week that it would be like a "fairy tale" if they win the entire competition this year. As recently as January, Sami Rekik took a timeout due to physical and mental exhaustion. However, it is not something that has been noticed during the rehearsals this week. With a massive confetti rain of red hearts, a torchlight parade and dancers with maximum energy, Medina has lived up to expectations. The youngest participant in the qualifiers, Eva Jumatate, took third place and thus goes to the finals with the entry "Selfish". She is the youngest participant in Melodifestivalen 2026 and has previously said that it feels nerve-wracking to make her debut, but that the fact that she is participating in her hometown of Kristianstad has calmed her nerves. When Jumatate participated in Talent as a ten-year-old, she moved Bianca Ingrosso to tears. Eight years later, she once again performs a ballad that has proven to be a hit on TV sofas. The difference is that she wrote the song herself and participates as an artist under her own name.

## Drop-in wedding in winsterskrud – Skansen made history
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-14 (today)

During Friday, Skansen was transformed into a wintry wedding oasis when the park for the first time arranged drop-in weddings on Valentine's Day. In the historic setting, surrounded by snow and sun, 26 people chose to get married – some before God and others before the state.  Wanted to create something new Elina Kouthoofd, who is the project manager at Skansen, says that the idea of ​​a winter wedding was sparked by the desire to create something new based on the popular summer concept.  - We run drop-in weddings in the summer and have done so for ten years. So we saw before 2026 that Valentine's Day was on a Saturday. Then we thought: Shouldn't we test the drop-in concept, but in the winter? Then there was a winter wedding on February 14, she says.  The atmosphere during Valentine's Day at Skansen is described as magical and filled with love.  - So much love in the air and in every place. It's magical, says Elina Kouthoofd.  In Seglora church from the 18th century, Tina Aandalen and Karl Aspengren got married. With around fifty guests, a priest and lively music, the couple exchanged rings in the historic building. However, the courtship took place just under two months ago.  - Karl proposed on the morning of Christmas Eve. We felt: Now we're driving! Yet we have waited over ten years for it to happen. Then it was just as good to just have it felled, says Tina Aandalen.  Groom Karl Aspengren wants to encourage others to take the plunge.  - If you feel like getting married, get married. It's super fun, he says.

DN DEBATE. We have shown it time and time again – for generations, Sweden's way of nurturing young talents in ice hockey has created world stars.

## Rubio's speech in Munich raises both hope and concern
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-14 (today)

Rubio's speech that the EU and the US must work together was received with some skepticism and at the same time with some relief among Europe's leaders. Malmer Stenergard points out that the more conciliatory tone from the US will not necessarily last over time. - Rubio extended a hand and said that you want to cooperate with Europe, you want things to go well for Europe. But the collaboration must take place where it is good for us. - In the conversations I have had with him, it has always been very constructive. However, other representatives have sounded different. We all remember the speech in Munich last year and Trump's statements about Greenland Focus on "white Europe" Dag Blanck, senior professor of North American studies at Uppsala University, believes that Rubio's speech is strongly influenced by American domestic politics. - This is a speech that speaks to Trump's core voters to a great extent, says Blanck.  He points out that minority groups such as African Americans, Latinos, Asians and indigenous peoples are completely excluded in Rubio's picture of Europe. According to Blanck, Rubio's message was a clear nationalist vision: - He criticized immigration and advocated a Europe that strengthens itself rather than driving global cooperation. He mentioned his roots in Spain and Italy, but not Cuba, and barely spoke at all about democracy or human rights. The focus was instead on Western European culture as a basis for cooperation, says Blanck. - You can say that it is a very narrow view of Europe, where it is defined as "white Europe", and where other groups are excluded from the picture. There is a clear connection to domestic politics in the United States.  Independence in focus European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called Rubio's speech "very reassuring", but pointed out that other representatives in the administration have a tougher tone. - Europe has no other choice but to become independent. We are facing a very strong threat from external forces that are trying to weaken our union from within, says von der Leyen.  At the same time, she also emphasized the need for increased defense

## Hjalmar, 6, doesn't get a school bus - has to walk along the E12
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-14 (today)

Because the family lives less than two kilometers from the bus stop, their six-year-old son Hjalmar is denied a school bus by the municipality of Storuman. He therefore has to walk along the E12 – where the cars drive at 90 kilometers per hour.  - It's scary. When trucks come, I feel like I'm going to be run over, he says.  The parents Johanna and Krister have appealed the decision to the administrative court, which assesses the stretch as dangerous for traffic. Even so, Hjalmar is not entitled to a taxi because they live too close to the pick-up point.  - We want the children to be treated fairly and here their safety is not taken into account, says Hjalmar's mother Johanna Sundin.  Getting help from a private actor Previously, they went into the forest to avoid the road, but now a private actor has offered to pick up Hjalmar for free. The family has been told by the municipality that the school bus would cost SEK 250,000 a year, but they consider that to be irrelevant to the discussion.  - I, who work in healthcare, know that you don't say "now it costs 300,000 for us to replace your hip", says Johanna Sundin. The parents have lived in Forsmark for 17 years. The municipality is now working to attract more people to the area, but the family believes that it is difficult to motivate other families with children to move there. - You don't want to say: "come and live here in Forsmark, but your child will have to follow a European path", says Hjalmar's father Krister Näslund. Parental responsibility applies to the Chairman of the Municipal Board in Storuman municipality, Ulrik Dahlgren (S), says that the decision rests with civil servants and administrative law. He is familiar with the route and admits that there are risks with the proximity to the road.   - This is a road that we all drive many times, so you know the route itself. He explains that parental responsibility applies, which means that it is up to the parents to follow Hjalmar to the bus stop. He cannot offer any suggestions for solutions to Hjalmar's school transport and regrets the dissatisfaction. - Yes, we're never happy when someone threatens to move when we take

## New report confirms: Navalny died of frog poison in Russian prison
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-14 (today)

Navalny died on February 16, 2024 in a penal colony in Siberia. Russian authorities have claimed he died of natural causes, but the Russian version is contested. Now a new investigation shows that he was poisoned with epibatidine – an extremely potent poison extracted from the skin of South American poison dart frogs and many times stronger than morphine. The symptoms include paralysis, severe convulsions and respiratory arrest and greatly increased blood pressure. - We have confirmed that a deadly toxin was found in Alexei Navalny's body. "Only the Russian government had the opportunity, motive and opportunity to use it against him in prison," said British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper. Great Britain: Russia despises its citizens The report is presented at a joint press meeting with all five countries' foreign ministers, but also Navalny's widow, during the security conference in Munich.  - That is why we are here today, to shine a spotlight on the Kremlin's barbaric attempts to silence Alexei Navalny. To show that the Russian government shows contempt for its citizens and is prepared to use this deadly poison, says Cooper. According to Sweden's Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard, experts from the five countries have been able to establish that Navalny was poisoned in Russian captivity. - With the help of experts from all five countries, we have established that he was poisoned by epibatidine. Only Russia could administer the poison because he was in captivity. Most likely, it was the FSB that was behind it, she says. Navalny's widow: No longer just words The investigation will now be handed over to the OPCW, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, to increase pressure on Russia. - We will hold Russia accountable in the OPCW and spread knowledge about the use of this highly potent poison to prevent its use again, says Malmer Stenergard. During the press conference, Navalny's widow, Yulia Navalny, took the opportunity to thank the European governments: - Now it's not just

## The answer when Europe shakes: A common Nordic defence
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-14 (today)

On Friday, the security conference began in Munich, with several world leaders in attendance. Ahead of this year's conference, the organizers have chosen to highlight the "elephant in the room", namely how the US's role in the world is changing and how well-established collaborations are threatened. Last year, US Vice President JD Vance shocked when he gave his speech with a harsh tone towards Europe. This year, the tone was considerably more accommodating. During Saturday's speech, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized that Europe and the US belong together and highlighted the importance of common security. But the new security situation has caused the Nordic countries to act. - One way to strengthen our security is to merge military units on the northern flank, says Magnus Christiansson, senior lecturer in military science at the University of Defense. - The idea is to send a signal to Russia: you cannot divide us. If a war breaks out on the northern flank, we are already united from the start. Getting more intense – because of the USA Christiansson explains that the Nordic countries are thinking about what other complements they can have to their NATO membership and how they can use it to strengthen their security regionally. This as a result of the US's changed policy and with the threats against Denmark - It is a process that has existed before but is now entering a more intensive stage, he says. The Nordic defense cooperation is today based on the Nordic Defense Cooperation, Nordefco, which means various cooperations that have existed with roots going back to the Cold War. In 2024, the Nordic countries signed an agreement on a joint defense concept – something that can now be intensified. Different experiences One challenge is the different historical experiences of the Nordic countries. - What is a lie in Copenhagen is the truth in Helsinki and that poses a problem. If Russia were to make a push, it would be viewed in completely different ways in the Nordic countries, says Christiansson. - But at the same time, I think this is being done to deter Russia and that is probably one of them

Pensioner Ulla, 69, from Nissafors, wanted to take the opportunity to highlight her home village when she sat in Nyhetsmorgon and scratched Triss.  - I come from Nissafors, a small village that is one mile from Lake Gnosjön. So we farmers are in town now, she jokes and adds: - Now it will be as exciting as the Olympics. An important message Ulla also took the opportunity to share an important message. She has previously worked as a metal worker and is missing a finger.  - If anyone is wondering, my fingers look a little strange. I'm missing a finger, but it's not because I'm a metalhead. It is a birth defect. If any young people are watching: You don't have to be perfect. Life will be great anyway. The joy after the scratch When Ulla scraped together a profit of SEK 15,000 a month for twenty years, there was a real howl of joy in the window. In total, the sum of SEK 3.6 million lands.  - Oh my God, thank you. So much on Valentine's Day, it's unbelievable. It's almost like I'm fainting, she says and takes the opportunity to send a greeting of love to her partner: - I'll be home soon.

## Bus loads of Iranian exiles on their way to Munich: "We will show"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-14 (today)

It has been more than a month since nationwide protests in Iran were crushed with brutal violence, leaving thousands dead.  At the same time, the annual security conference is taking place in Munich, where the exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi is calling for global demonstrations against the regime on Saturday, focusing on the big cities of Munich, Los Angeles and Toronto. "Iranians abroad and freedom-loving people around the world, February 14 is the global day of action in solidarity with Iran's Sun and Lion Revolution, a day to take to the streets and force the international community to take urgent, practical measures in support of the Iranian people," he wrote in a post on X. Exile Iranians from around the world, including Sweden, are now joining the demonstration. Several buses have departed from Gothenburg, Malmö and Stockholm to the giant demonstration that is expected in Munich.  Want to show unity On board one of the buses from Malmö is the Swedish-Iranian Fariba Boustanchi, who traveled for over 14 hours to be the voice of the Iranian people. - The Iranian regime has systematically violated human rights, imprisoned and executed political opponents and suppressed women for several decades. Due to the ongoing and serious situation in Iran, we have gathered here to be the voice of the Iranian people, she says on board the bus on the way to Munich. - We must show the outside world that we agree with each other both outside and inside Iran. We want to draw the world's attention to Iran, she continues. Fariba is one of many Iranians who hope for regime change in Iran. She calls for international support and expresses support for former Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi. - Iranians have expressed very clearly for several years that the Iranian regime is not our representative and that they do not want the mullahs as leaders in Iran. - We demand international recognition of the crown prince as a legitimate representative of Iran. He is the only reliable leader in the opposition to the Islamic regime from

## The sadness of the restaurants - that Valentine's Day is on a Saturday
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-14 (today)

This year, Saturday does not give the same extra boost as when Valentine's Day falls on a weekday. Saturdays are already popular for restaurant visits, while weekdays usually get a bigger boost from the holiday. 
 
Most of the reservations for the restaurants on Valentine's Day are for two people, but since it is Saturday, larger groups can also show up, which sometimes affects the intimate atmosphere. 
  
- It can be very intimate and the sound level can be a little lower. But we in the staff usually make sure that everyone feels comfortable and can talk. We joke and sing. It will be nice for everyone here, says Felicia Bonaccorso. Many restaurants fully booked Bonaccorso has been fully booked for several months before Valentine's Day. According to BokaBord, which made a compilation of reservations from 440 restaurants in Stockholm, nearly 70 percent are fully booked during dinner time on Valentine's Day. The booking situation is roughly the same as last year, with an increase of just under two percent. 
  
- When I was inside myself looking for a free table for two on BokaBord, I saw that there are only 129 restaurants that have a free table tomorrow, compared to 400 restaurants in Stockholm on a normal Saturday, says Peder Dinkelspiel, founder of BokaBord.  Strained financial situation Despite the fact that the booking situation is good, many restaurants continue to have a tough time financially. Many are struggling to repay tax deferrals from the pandemic and guests are spending less than before. 
  
- The booking situation looks good and it is true. But the notes are smaller. Many restaurateurs testify to that, says Peder Dinkelspiel.

## The baby Emanuel is to be deported to Iran - then the organization warns
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-14 (today)

According to Rädda Barnen, it is unlikely that the legislators intended that newborn children should be able to be deported when their parents have the right to stay in Sweden. In Emanuel's case, the decision is based on the fact that the rules for so-called track change were changed shortly before his birth - without transitional provisions for families who were already in the country. - I am convinced that no legislator imagined that this could be the consequence. But when many major changes are implemented in a short time, no one has time to review the consequences, says children's rights lawyer Karin Sjömilla. The Prime Minister: "Sounds unreasonable" Several leading politicians have reacted to the case. Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson has called the data "unreasonable". Even Ebba Busch has described the situation as unreasonable, and Jimmie Åkesson has said that he does not believe there is legal support for deporting an eight-month-old baby. Recently, several high-profile cases have involved children and teenagers who are at risk of deportation. Among other things, the discussion has been about possible exceptions for certain groups, such as so-called high school youth. But point efforts are not enough, says Karin Sjömilla. Save the Children instead calls for a broad review of the legislation at its core, to ensure that the best interests of the child actually have an impact. "The best interests of the child must be put aside" Among other things, the possibility to grant a residence permit due to "particularly painful circumstances" has been removed and replaced with the significantly more restrictive requirement "particularly painful reasons", something which has had major consequences according to Karin Sjömilla. - It is a very strict limitation. At the same time, politics sends the signal that as few as possible should be allowed to stay. This leads to the rules being interpreted narrowly, and then the best interests of the child often have to take a backseat to the principle of regulated immigration, she says. According to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the best interests of the child must be a fundamental starting point in all decisions concerning children. But in practice, that principle does not have enough impact, says Karin Sjömil

## Ambulance personnel scooped up Leo, 77 - praised for the effort
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-14 (1 day old)

When Leo Selmerhagen returned home to Tomelilla in Skåne after a week at his special home, he was greeted by an unexpected sight – a two-metre high wall of snow blocked the entrance.   - I was totally blown away. I will never be able to do this, I thought. He didn't get in with the car and had to get in through a small crack.  - I barely got through the door. Took help via Facebook Leo is wary of physical exertion due to heart problems and therefore took help via the Facebook group Anslagstavlan Österlen. Shortly afterwards, an ambulance rolled into the lot. - I thought it was Särbo who had called as a precaution. But it wasn't like that. It turned out that the ambulance nurses Annette Lindelöf and David Sunesson had seen Leo's appeal and since they had time to spare – they rushed out to help. - They jumped out of the car and said "Hurry up, give us each a shovel" and then they started bouncing like two snow blowers, says Leo Selmerhagen.  "Shows empathy" Since the paramedics were nearby, there was no hesitation in going there.  - For us, it was obvious to help. It is not difficult to extend a helping hand and you yourself feel very good about it, says Annette Lindelöf to Ystads Allehanda.   Leo Selmerhagen lives at a height where it is usually very windy. He calls the place "Windy hill" and is used to a lot of snow, but this time it was unusually heavy. - I have been in the air force in Luleå, but this was seven trips worse. The incident was documented and posted on Facebook, where the effort has been met with many positive comments and tributes. - This shows the empathy that is needed in the world, says Leo Selmerhagen.

## Increased safety in the mountains ahead of the sports holiday
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-14 (1 day old)

This ski season, there have been several serious incidents at the Swedish mountain destinations. 
In December, a 20-year-old man died in one of the ski slopes in Åre, and at the beginning of January, a 45-year-old man died in Björnrike in Vemdalen. What caused the fatal accidents is currently being investigated, but the events have shed light on the state of safety on the slopes at the ski resorts. 

In Lofsdalen there have been no serious incidents this winter, but there have been some incidents where skiers have injured themselves on the slopes.  - There have been a few knee injuries and wrist injuries. says Jonny Larsson, site manager in Lofsdalen.

 How do you work to make the slopes as safe as possible? 

- We put nets and mattresses on obstacles so the skiers don't injure themselves, and we inform them that we have low-speed zones through signs on the slopes, says Jonny Larsson, site manager in Lofsdalen. Many have been injured on the slopes When TV4 talks to holidaymakers on the ski slope, several of them say that they have at some point injured themselves on the ski slope or have friends or relatives who have been affected. - My daughter was riding and was inattentive and destroyed her knee, not that it broke completely, but got a stretch on both ligaments and cruciate ligaments, says Anders Börjesson. But there are things to keep in mind to reduce the risk of injury on the ski slopes. For example, using a helmet and other protection, having the right settings on your ski bindings, adjusting your speed and training your core and leg strength before you go on a skiing holiday. - I think a bit like this: No one goes to a cross-country competition without training first. The same should apply to downhill skiing. That you have trained your muscles a little before you go to the mountains and go slaloming or snowboarding for a whole week, says ski instructor Stella Elm.

## The duo will break the world record in ping-pong – aiming for 24 hours
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-13 (1 day old)

The last time "The spin duo" tried to break a new world record, they failed after just over 13 hours of playing. In the past, those who have stood the longest have stood for 15 hours and 49 minutes, but now the goal is to play for an entire day without dropping the ball. The current world record of 16 hours and 2 seconds was set by two people in the Netherlands.   Practical challenges Playing table tennis for 24 hours requires some preparation. Fredrik Nilsson says that this time they have a special plan for toilet visits. - We will run with the classic adult diaper this time. We can't pee ourselves in live broadcast, he says in Efter fem. - Even if you have Northern Europe's best bladder, you have to drive 24 hours, so better to be safe than sorry, adds Emil Ohlsson. But it is only number one that is relevant, the duo underlines. - Nothing else comes up, says Fredrik Nilsson. "It will be too boring" The player duo tells us that there will be officials on site in Västerås. During the record attempt, they will receive viewer questions and talk a lot, something that will be important to keep the concentration up.   - If we hadn't talked to the audience, we would never have managed to set a world record. It will be too boring, simply, to stand with Emil for 24 hours, says Fredrik Nilsson. - Even though we are damn good friends, we get tired of each other too, says Emil Ohlsson. "Will drive straight into the tile" The duo are determined to play for 24 hours and in doing so also beat the current record of 16 hours and two seconds.  - We have to take that away from them, says Fredrik.  - That is priority one, but then we will drive straight into the tile, concludes Emil.

## New ice day in sight - here it could be minus 40 this weekend
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-13 (1 day old)

This year's winter has been a cold story. For several weeks the temperature has been well below zero. The chilly weather is expected to last. And during Saturday, even lower temperatures are expected, down to minus 37-40 in Gielas, in the Västerbottenfjällen.

- The cold air is already about to swing in from the northeast, because the high pressure is strengthening and taking the cold air with it to the south, says Ulrika Elvgren, TV4 meteorologist. Colder January for a long time January has been colder than normal throughout the country. In Pajala the coldest since the measurements started in 1940. In Karesuando the coldest since 1893. In many places in the Tornedalen January has been among the three coldest that have been measured. 

- The coldest so far this year has been minus 40.8 degrees in Gielas on January 4. And here it can be down to 40 degrees this weekend. Last year's lowest temperature in the country was minus 36 degrees, says Ulrika Elvgren. High pressure over Sweden has been blocked The fact that the cold has kept Sweden in a firm grip for so long is because a high pressure over Scandinavia has been blocked. In summer the high pressure causes heat waves, in winter they cause the cold to linger.

- We have had high pressure since January, and right now there is nothing that breaks it down. It's because we don't have any jet streams here, they go by the Mediterranean Sea, where they cause storm Nils, among other things, says Ulrika Elvgren.

According to researchers, the fact that the jet streams have lost power is due to the climate changes affecting the Earth's polar regions.

- The jet streams that run in a north-south direction have lost their sting, which allows the cold air to get from the polar regions and south. We would need traction from jet streams to bring up some heat from the south, says Ulrika Elvgren. Chilly for the rest of the month But right now there are no such signs. The cold will last, shows SMHI's long-term forecast. 

- It will probably be cold for the rest of the month. And in March, you don't yet see that the jet streams change to any great degree. We have a real winter this year, says Ulrika Elvgren.

But to last

## Pokemon fever ahead of European Championships: "High level of enthusiasm"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-13 (1 day old)

Over the years, Pokemon has had both ups and downs in popularity, but now the interest seems to be greater than in a long time. In London, fans from all over Europe gather to participate, watch the competitions and meet like-minded people. - Those I have spoken to so far, they say they have been waiting for this for a long period, says Thomas Kvarnkullen, foreign reporter. "Followed all my life" Amar Palm is a pokemon enthusiast and has tens of thousands of cards in his collection.  - When I was little, I opened packs with my mother. I have always been a big collector. Pokemon is the only thing that has accompanied me all my life, says Amar Palm in Efter fem. Several of Amar's cards are very valuable. One of his most exclusive cards, a so-called Bubble Mew, can be worth up to SEK 30,000. However, selling the cards is not an option. - I get separation anxiety just from the thought of selling the cards, says Amor Palm. Millions for rare cards The Pokemon trend is not only felt among fans - it is also clearly visible in the market. A unique Pokémon card is currently for sale for over 5 million dollars, equivalent to just over 50 million kroner. The value of the card is due to its unique history and condition and it has never been available in regular packs. - Combined with the fact that you couldn't open it in any pack plus it being a ten makes it the most desirable card in all of Pokémon, says Amar Palm.

## The expert totally saws Katja Nyberg's argument
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-13 (1 day old)

On Friday, Katja Nyberg took part in the newspaper Kvartal's Friday interview. In the podcast, she says that the Swedish Transport Agency revoked her driver's license because they found a metabolite of cocaine, i.e. a chemical residue, and that it is "not an active substance". - Then the question is how it got into my body, says Nyberg. When asked how the residual product could have arisen, she replies: - I have not taken any cocaine. I deny wrongdoing. Nyberg's lawyer has previously used a similar argument. "For an unknown reason, a rapid test gave a result for cocaine, but only for the metabolite and not the narcotic substance," the lawyer wrote in a letter to the Swedish Transport Agency, which TV4 previously reported on. Swedish Medical Examiner's Office: Can only occur if you take cocaine Jimmy Blomqvist Larsson, press officer at the Swedish Medical Examiner's Office, dismisses the reasoning completely. Benzoylecgonine, i.e. the residual product you measure to see if someone has taken cocaine, is classified as a narcotic in itself. If you test positive for that, you are automatically guilty of a drug crime, even if it is not the active substance, he says. In addition, he says that if the metabolite is present in the blood, it always means that you have taken cocaine. - If you've had it in your body, you've had cocaine in your body, says Jimmy Blomqvist Larsson. If benzoylecgonine is found in the body, can it be equated with having used cocaine? - Yes. Could this metabolite occur in some other way than if you took cocaine? - No. Became a political wild It was in the intervening days that Katja Nyberg was stopped by the police after a game accident. The police found a bag of white powder, and she has since been investigated for drunk driving and drug offences. At the end of January, the Swedish Transport Agency revoked her driver's license after drugs were detected in the test results. She has been dismissed from several heavy assignments and became a political wild after the scandal. Katja Nyberg has previously worked as a police officer and was the Sweden Democrats' spokesperson on police issues. During

## Details: Principal arrested for multiple rapes against former student
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-13 (1 day old)

The police carried out an operation in a municipality in Central Sweden late last night and arrested a man. - The person is suspected of several cases of rape and has been detained since last night, says the prosecutor who leads the preliminary investigation. According to information to TV4 Nyheterna, the suspect is a principal at a school. The victim, who is a minor, has previously been a student at the same school. The criminal suspicions against the principal are said to have strengthened during the day. - Last night the person was arrested on reasonable suspicion (the lower level of suspicion) and now I have just made the decision that the arrest remains but now on probable grounds, the higher level of suspicion. We have gone through more evidence and the person is heard with his defender, says the prosecutor. Denies crime The suspected sexual crimes must have taken place for about a year and a half, according to the prosecutor. - I cannot comment on how many cases are involved, but there are several cases of rape and it must have taken place during a period from the summer of 2024 to the beginning of this year. The prosecutor confirms that the suspected perpetrator is employed at a school, but does not want to comment on TV4 Nyheter's information that he works as a principal. - The arrested person denies the crime. Now the investigation continues. We will hold further interrogations and carry out technical investigations and a review of technical seizures. TV4 Nyheterna has contacted the relevant municipality for a comment. By Sunday at the latest, the prosecutor must request the rector's arrest. The lawyer does not want to comment.

## The winter sickness is here - and cases are expected to increase
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-11 (3 days old)

More cases of winter sickness are now being reported in Sweden. The number is expected to continue to increase, according to the Public Health Authority.   - It is quite likely that the peak has not been reached, but it is difficult to know. The vast majority do not seek care for the symptoms and then not everyone is included in the statistics, says Acting State Epidemiologist Erik Sturegård. The winter sickness is caused by calicivirus which is highly contagious and resistant. Hand sanitizer is not enough and it takes a very small amount of the virus to make you sick. - It can also withstand dehydration, which means that you can become infected long after you have come into contact with it.  Easy to confuse with food poisoning Erik Sturegård believes that mouth protection is only recommended if you are exposed to large amounts of viruses, such as in healthcare. A common mistake is to mistake winter sickness for food poisoning. - There are similar symptoms, but with food poisoning you get sick right away and then quickly get well again. But it can be difficult to know, and therefore one should not take chances but assume that it is winter sickness.  The risk of infection is particularly high for families with small children and specifically when cooking. - If you get sick, it is very important that you do not cook for others. If you have sick children, it is important that they stay at home for at least 48 hours after the last bout of vomiting and diarrhoea. More cases than last year The latest increase in cases is in line with the Public Health Agency's forecast. At the moment, the numbers are higher than compared to last year and it is difficult to say when the spread can conceivably slow down.  - It is possible to work to bring the numbers down if we are meticulous about hygiene. The spread usually takes place over a relatively long period and it is greatly influenced by the efforts we make.
