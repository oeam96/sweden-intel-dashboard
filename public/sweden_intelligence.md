## Considering alternatives to attack on Iran: "Only Trump knows"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-27 (today)

US President Donald Trump has been briefed on several possible military options against Iran, ABC News reports citing information. Admiral Brad Cooper, in charge of US forces in the Middle East, presented the options to the president during a meeting at the White House on Thursday. Dan Caine, the US defense chief, also participated, writes the news site.   The briefing took place on the same day that the US and Iran held indirect talks in Geneva on Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The talks ended without an agreement, but Iran said "technical talks" will resume in Vienna next week. Israel should strike first Several high-ranking Republicans around the president have suggested in the past week that Israel should strike first, and that the United States should help if necessary. This is what people with insight into the discussions told ABC News. The idea behind the proposal is to avoid the United States appearing as the party that starts a new conflict. Analysts interviewed by ABC News believe the arrangement could also give Republican lawmakers political leeway in an election year, since Trump campaigned on "ending wars, not starting them." At the same time, it is warned that such a strategy risks being perceived as an "Israel-supported coup" in the region. "The media can continue to speculate" White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly does not want to comment on the information about possible military moves. - The media can continue to speculate about the president's thoughts as much as they want, but only President Trump knows what he will or will not do, says White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly. According to ABC News, it was still unclear Thursday whether Trump, who their sources say is growing increasingly frustrated with Iran's refusal to accede to his demands to halt uranium enrichment and limit its ballistic missile program, has actually adopted any of the proposed plans.

## Warns of new pandemic: "Can't even handle a normal summer"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-27 (today)

At the end of 2019, most people heard about covid-19 for the first time. Within months it was seen everywhere. In the grocery store, on public transport, at work. And not least in hospitals worldwide.  

- It was a dizzying time. Equipment that was out of date, that was found in some spare warehouse. There were many colleagues from all professional categories who only worked for a few weeks in intensive care. And immediately it was full of patients who were so unbelievably sick, says Ingrid Stubelius, chief intensive care physician at Sahlgrenska University Hospital. Poor preparedness Six years later, Ingrid Stubelius meets TV4 in ICU at Mölndal hospital to talk about her memories of the pandemic. The situation is very different today than it was then. The staff do not have mouth guards and visors on them.  The department is no longer filled to maximum capacity. The patients are no longer young, otherwise healthy people who need ventilators. A calm prevails. The pandemic is over.

But according to the Medical Association, it is only a matter of time before the next crisis comes and then they do not believe that our preparedness is sufficient.

- Are we well prepared? We are not, I would say. Today, care cannot cope with an ordinary crisis, cannot even cope with an ordinary summer, perhaps cannot even cope with everyday life every time. We need to be honest and say that healthcare is underfunded and we do a lot of things that maybe we shouldn't have to do. And we need to focus more on the core business, says Hanna Kataoka, second vice-chairman, Swedish Medical Association. Care needs to practice Care and care are, together with the education sector, the industries where the largest proportion feel that they often or always have too high a workload.

- Healthcare personnel need to practice preparedness. As it stands today, much is about solving emergency situations. There is no room for training on preparedness, says Hanna Kataoka. 

Ingrid Stubelius hopes that preparedness is better than it was before covid-19.

- There are so many points where preparedness broke down during the pandemic. Then hop

**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-27 (today)

Hillary Clinton says she had "no idea" about Jeffrey Epstein's criminality. On Thursday, she was questioned for six hours behind closed doors by the House Oversight Committee in Chappaqua, New York, where she and husband Bill Clinton live. In her opening statement, which she published on X before the hearing, Clinton wrote that she does not remember ever meeting Epstein and that she neither traveled on his plane nor visited his home, island or office. She added that, after the crimes became known, she "like any honest person" has been outraged by what has come to light about the crimes of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. "We asked for it" After the long session, Clinton expressed frustration that the committee chose to hold the hearing behind closed doors. She believed that the process should have been public and that she would have liked to have avoided reproducing the content afterwards. - You could have seen it with your own eyes. We asked for it. It would have been better for the committee and their efforts to gather the information they are looking for, she said.  Demands that Trump testify Hillary Clinton wants Donald Trump to be called to a similar hearing. Democrat Robert Garcia also demands that Trump be heard, but so far the committee's Republican leadership has not taken any initiative in that direction. But on Friday, ex-president Bill Clinton will be questioned. - It will be tougher today. None of them are accused of any crime, but the members of Congress will undoubtedly have many questions for Bill Clinton, especially the Republican ones, says TV4's foreign reporter Filip Jacobson.

## Taking customers to court - could play with empty accounts
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-26 (today)

It was on the morning of May 13 last year that something went wrong on ATG Casino's website when a security lock was triggered. Suddenly, games could be played without money in the account and customers with zero kroner in the balance could withdraw winnings via Swish.  Word of the bug quickly spread on social media and players rushed to the platform. Now ATG collects money from players in district courts and via the Kronofogden, after the so-called "bug day".  - We had a technical problem which meant that customers could withdraw money they were not entitled to. Quite quickly we fixed it, shut down the error, and then we ended up in the situation we are in now, says Jan Sonnevi.  In the last month alone, the company has won or settled over 20 civil cases linked to the incident. - They got several chances to pay. We sent reminders, but in the end we had to send them on to the Norwegian Kronofogdemyndigheten, says Jan Sonnevi, casino manager at ATG.  In total, ATG has upwards of 300 claim cases in court from last year and this year, although it is not confirmed that all of them concern the bug.  Turnover increased fivefold On May 16, ATG sent refunds to players who received winnings paid out without coverage. According to reports that TV4 has seen, the turnover on that day was fivefold compared to a normal day. The same judgments also show that the number of new players was 24 times higher. - They know what they are doing, it is money they are not entitled to, but they try to take it anyway, says Julia Axelsson, contract law lawyer.  Hope for a solution There are still a large number of claims that have not yet gone to court. Exactly when the process is over is difficult to say. - We of course hope that it will be resolved as soon as possible. We have no intention or desire to pursue a process against our customers, we want to move on, so I hope it ends as soon as possible, says Jan Sonnevi.

## They want to divide the sports holiday - to avoid the Stockholmers
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-26 (today)

Split up the sports holiday weeks - to spread the Stockholmers out in the mountains. That is what Kalle Schröder, who runs a hotel in Lofsdalen, suggests.  - My proposal is to break out parts of those who have sports leave in week nine and let them have it in week seven, eight or ten instead. Schröder believes that today's division leads to higher prices and unnecessary congestion in the ski resorts. However, he sees difficulties in implementing the change.  - It could be a problem for families who have children in different schools or parents who work at the school. "The Stockholmers come and buffalo around" Kalle Schröder can imagine that there will be pressure on the ski resorts when all the Stockholmers arrive at the same time.  - Many people from the mountains would probably think that the Stockholmers come and buff around, take up a lot of space, are seen and heard. But there are a lot of lovely Stockholmers too. Magnus Noppa, CEO of the Swedish ski facilities organization, agrees that week nine stands out and welcomes the proposal. He sees that the behavior on the slopes has become more stressed - and that people are less considerate. - I think we see a trend in society as a whole that you come from a stress in everyday life where a lot goes very fast. Then you take it with you when you go on holiday. Has become more expensive According to the comparison service Zmarta, an average ski trip costs SEK 33,000 for a family with two adults and two children in 2026. - The same ski holiday today takes a significantly larger share of the household's finances. Wages have simply not kept up with the lift up to the price peak, says Ola Söderlind, household economist at Zmarta/uScore. Kalle Schröder believes that a change would make sports leave available to more people. The current division is part of a boring social development, according to him.   - It is frustrating. The result is that many friends cannot afford to go and that a large part of the population does not get access to the beauty of nature.

## Man turned away - bar staff mistook Parkinson's for drunk
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-26 (today)

The incident at a pub in Södermalm in December has been reported by three people. The man behaved calmly and was not loud, writes one of the complainants. "Despite this, he was suddenly told by the security guard, via the bartender, to leave the premises, with the justification that he was considered 'too drunk'. The man's tremors and impaired motor skills, which are symptoms of Parkinson's disease, are the reason why he was rejected, according to the complainants - who call what happened deeply offensive. "The incident testifies to a lack of knowledge, sensitivity and respect towards people with disabilities. I therefore consider this treatment to be unacceptable and should be reviewed," writes the complainant further. Told about the illness - asked to leave. One of the complainants describes how relatives of the man told the staff that the tremors were due to illness and not intoxication. But they then allegedly received a "rejecting and harsh" treatment. "Despite my explanation, the staff at the bar were determined that he was not welcome," reads one of the reports. DO is now investigating the report about discrimination and requires the owner company to answer about the incident.

## Swedes were recruited into the Nazi killer cult
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-26 (today)

A man in his 20s was arrested on Friday on suspicion of participation in a terrorist organization and damage connected to Sweden's security.  Now the newspaper Expo can reveal that the man was the driving force in building up a Swedish branch of the online violent group Maniac Murder Cult (MKU), and recruited members.  The man was arrested and detained on Wednesday. He had then been active in the environments since at least November 6 last year, according to the prosecutor. He has previously been suspected of damage connected to Sweden's security.  Recruitment via social media According to Expo's review, the 20-year-old allegedly ran a TikTok account with the aim of recruiting for a Swedish MKU cell. 

The account is said to have commented on posts from Nordic Resistance Movement activists to profile MKU as action-oriented, writes Expo. Interested parties must then have been forwarded to encrypted chats in Signal and to groups on Telegram.  Expo states that the newspaper had access to parts of the cell's encrypted chats, where a Swedish administrator account is said to have spread violent propaganda, Nazism and terror manuals. In November 2025, the administrator wrote: "Some of you in this chat owe us blood. You know who you are and I'm waiting," according to Expo. The cell states that it is located in five Swedish municipalities. Is singled out as the leader Michail Chkhikvishvili has been singled out as MKU's leader, writes Expo. On New Year's Eve 2023, he planned a mass murder of Jewish children in New York by having a member dress up as Santa and hand out poisoned candy. The plan was stopped by the FBI. He was arrested in 2024 and extradited to the United States in 2025, where he faces up to 40 years in prison. "The outstanding investigative work in this case saved countless lives and underscores the crucial behind-the-scenes activity of our federal law enforcement agents," Attorney General Pamela Bondi said at the time of the arrest. MKU was founded around 2018 in Ukraine by Yegor Krasnov, according to Expo. The head of the preliminary investigation, chamber prosecutor Lars Hedvall, ha

## The police's sharp warning - in the SOS app: "Be careful"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-26 (today)

During the afternoon and evening of February 25, the police received an unusually high number of calls about fraud and attempted fraud in the Stockholm area.  In total, there are approximately 25 reports of both digital and physical fraud, where the fraudsters pretend to work at a care company - This is an unusually high number. Almost all reports concern crimes in Stockholm municipality, aimed at plaintiffs who are mainly in their 80s and older, says Maryam Zafaranlou, group manager at the Fraud Section in the Stockholm region, in a press release. The wave of reports meant that the police finally issued a warning message in the SOS Alarms app on Thursday evening. "Due to the number of reported fraud attempts on the elderly in the Stockholm region, the police would like to urge elderly people to be careful and not let unknown people in at the door", the police write in the warning and urge the recipient to call 112 in the event of ongoing or recent crimes. "Close the door if something feels wrong" Most reports involve a text message in which the fraudsters claim to work for a home care company that will come and clean the home of the person who is contacted. The person is also asked to call a phone number that is in the text message. When this number is called, the victim of a crime can speak to an additional person who will pick up valuables, money or bank cards at the person's home. The police are now urging victims not to call the number in the text message. - We also want to urge the elderly not to let unknown people into the home and to contact the police immediately if they suspect a crime. Close the door if something feels wrong. The police, insurance companies, banks or other serious companies never go home to collect bank cards, codes, jewelry or other valuables, says Maryam Zafaranlou, and continues: - We also emphasize the importance of talking about how to protect yourself against fraud with elderly relatives and acquaintances.

## 16-year-old snacks were sold in stores: "You get angry, not sick"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-26 (today)

It was P4 Västmanland that was the first to tell about the life store in Fagersta that sold 16-year-old snack bags. The environmental administration had received a complaint from a customer and then went out to do a food inspection.  The bag was sold with a best-before date of September 2026 – but if you tore off the label, it turned out that the real date was in July 2010. Relabeling prohibited Marie-Louise Danielsson-Tham, professor of food hygiene, explains that it is forbidden to change the best-before date on food.
- It is forbidden to relabel a product with a longer shelf life, she says.

At the same time, she says that it is not illegal to sell goods where the best before date has passed, as long as it is done with the original label. - In that case, I would recommend that they had sold these with the original markings. But on the other hand, who would want to buy 16 year old corn balls? How to detect old snacks How do you know if the snacks are too old?
- Of course you taste them. The first thing that usually happens is that they go rancid, explains Danielsson-Tham. She also advises to pay attention to packaging where labels are pasted on top of the original labelling.
- If you see that something is stuck on a package, then you should be suspicious and ask the store what it is about. Snacks can last for several months According to Danielsson-Tham, it is difficult to say exactly how long snacks such as cheese balls and corn balls last, but they are often edible several months after the best before date if the bag is well sealed. - Months after the best-before date, they should be edible, she says.

## Eurovision already decided - if you ask the comedian
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-26 (today)

According to the site Eurovision World, which compiles the betting companies' odds, the Finnish-Swedish violinist Linda Lampenius and her song "Liekinheitin" are currently favorites to win the entire "Eurovision Song Contest". According to "Morgonpasset i P3" profile and comedian Branne Pavlovic, it's easy to understand why. When classical violin meets techno music, a sound that brings to mind Vanessa-Mae emerges. - It's a damn banger, he says to TV4 Nyheterna. Pavlovic is usually right Branne Pavlovic says he follows Eurovision because every year there are usually at least one or two songs that end up on his gym playlist. As a comedian, he is also attracted by the beauty aspect of the competition. - You want to see who will be the craziest this year. Most important, however, is the conviction of one's own musical ear. When he heard Loreen's "Tattoo" he knew immediately that it would go all the way. He feels the same confidence before "Liekinheitin". - I find it very difficult to see that this one will not win. Means flamethrower in Finnish One detail in the song puzzles Branne Pavlovic, however: the chorus where pop star Pete Parkkonen sings "You are a flamethrower". - So it sounds very strange, says Linda Lampenius to TV4 Nyheterna. But "Liekinheitin" means flamethrower in Finnish and according to her the song is about falling in love, where she herself is the "flamethrower" that makes people obsessed.

- But when they get too close, I become ice cold and switch off. Piken against Swedish Mello That the duo is tipped as favorites even before the Finnish selection takes place on Saturday surprises her. - We have worked extremely hard and made all the preparations we can. We will give such a hell of a live show, she says. - I'm sorry, but I have to say that it is of higher quality than in Swedish. Sorry. So Finnish Mello has uprooted something completely copycat. Will succeed in what KAJ could not She and Pete Parkkonen have not yet had any contact with last year's Finnish-Swedish contributor KAJ. - Our number is not based on humor on the same

## The Tax Agency gives in - after Ulla-Lena's fight: "Finally"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-26 (today)

In connection with Ulla-Lena Lindqvist becoming a widow, she bought a summer cottage in Vidja outside Stockholm. But in 2023, unknown people began registering at Ulla-Lena's cottage - hundreds of people who have no connection to the house. Ulla-Lena turned to both the police and the Tax Agency, but at first she got no help there. In the end, she sued the state for violation of the European Convention together with the Center for Justice. In connection with that, Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson (M) was called to the tax committee and announced that she would discuss a solution with the Swedish Tax Agency. Two months passed and nothing happened - until now. "Happy news" Today, Ulla-Lena received an apology from the Swedish Tax Agency together with the message that all unauthorized persons at her address have now been removed. - It is a huge relief that they have finally acted. Now I can finally enjoy my cabin again. But I don't want anyone else to have to go through this, so the Swedish Tax Agency must find a solution for everyone affected, she tells TV4 Nyheterna. Ulla-Lena's representative Fredrik Bäärnhielm Thorslund at the Center for Justice describes it as happy news. - It is a clear receipt of what we have been saying all along: that this problem can actually be solved, if you choose to add the mane. Now we hope that the Swedish Tax Agency will go ahead and also help the many others who have been affected by fraud in a similar way as Ulla-Lena, says her representative Fredrik Bäärnhielm Thorslund at the Center for Justice. The lawsuit against the state, run with the help of the Center for Justice, continues. 20,000 complaints – every year Ulla-Lena Lindqvist is not alone in being affected by incorrect bookkeeping. The Swedish Tax Agency annually receives around 20,000 complaints from people who have discovered that someone else is registered at their address. - For Ulla-Lena, it is a clear problem that many people subscribe to her address and use her summer cottage as a mailbox for criminals. It is completely unacceptable that it tolerates

## Sida's director general resigns
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-26 (today)

After consultation with the government, Jakob Granit will instead become director general in the Government Office and will leave his current position tomorrow, February 27. Sida's chief executive officer Hanna Hellquist will be interim director general until further notice. An official replacement will be recruited. Sida tells TV4 Nyheterna that they found out about the news very recently and that they have nothing to comment on. Development Minister Benjamin Dousa's press secretary Jakob Zeiler also does not want to give any comment, other than that the process has gone right. Internal criticism There has long been criticism of Jakob Granit from the authority's employees. According to an employee survey that DN reported on this spring, the staff had low confidence in both him and the management. According to information given to TV4 Nyheterna, there have been differences in Granit's and the board's views on how the authority should be governed. Jakob Granit took office as director general of the Swedish Aid Agency on September 1, 2023. Johansson (S): The government closely controlled Sida in an extremely corrupt way Morgan Johansson, the Social Democrats' foreign policy spokesperson, writes in a comment to TV4 Nyheterna that the resignation is surprising and that he wonders what is behind it. "It is well known that the government has controlled the authority in detail in an extremely corrupt way, alien to Swedish administrative tradition. For example, the government pushed for the now infamous payments of bribe money to the relatives and acquaintances of the Prime Minister of Somalia.
Another noteworthy event is when the government this year demanded that Sida pay out millions of kroner to SD's "aid organization" Hepatica, even though their applications did not measure up.  It cannot have been easy to be DG for Sida under those circumstances, and perhaps he has now simply had enough.”

## Goes to new attack on the Swede: "Complete idiot"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-26 (today)

The row between team Niklas Edin and Canada degenerated after the Swedes accused the Canadians of cheating in the Olympics, when they touched their stones after they were released. Canada's Marc Kennedy did not appreciate the Swedish protests and told the Swedes "fuck off" repeatedly. Now Kennedy's teammate Ben Hebert says in the podcast "Big show with Rusic & Rose" that he also handed out boots to Oskar Eriksson on the ice. "He's a weasel" It was lucky my mic was off, let's say that. He had a taste, says Hebert and continues: He is a weasel. He's an unreal player and it's lucky he is, because he's a complete idiot and nobody likes him. But we just brush it off. After the victory over Sweden, Canada went all the way and took Olympic gold. Team Edin, Olympic champion in 2022, finished second last. We weren't going to put up with the bullying and bullshit. We hit them square in the face, that's what we did. We took first place and stood on the podium with the gold medal, says Hebert. "Rather play clean" Oskar Eriksson tells TT that he is not very surprised by Hebert's words.  We are fully aware that he is so. He can think what he wants. No one else has said that, but I've only had positive feedback from all the other players who have come forward. I don't know if there is anyone outside of Canada who has supported the Canadian way of being, says Eriksson. Eriksson says that the teams have not spoken to each other after the fight.  There has been no attempt to apologize, but they don't think they've done anything wrong, says Eriksson. I'd much rather play fair and square, and lose or win that way, than break the rules and win. I have won an Olympic gold and now they have too. If they feel proud, they can do it. Marc Kennedy was given a verbal warning by the International Curling Federation after the words.

## Major oil spill in Malmö
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-26 (today)

The coast guard, the rescue service and the police are on site in Malmö harbor to investigate the oil spill.  - We have received information from the coast guard that discovered a major oil spill in the harbor basin in Malmö, says Joel Johansson, officer on duty at the rescue service. The operation began in the afternoon and responsible authorities are now trying to identify where the oil is coming from. - We will have drones on site and see if we can establish where the oil spill is coming from, says Karin Cars, press communicator at the Coast Guard. Charles de Gaulle In the harbor is the French ship Charles de Gaulle, the largest aircraft carrier in Europe. But the authorities cannot yet say anything about whether the oil comes from there. There are several other tankers in the port. Is it a small amount of oil or is it a large spill? - I have no idea about that at the moment.

## Opens up after Trump's locker room joke: 'Tasteless'
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-26 (today)

Team captain Hilary Knight would rather focus on the women's success at the Olympics than the US president's comment. - We are just focusing on celebrating the women in our team, the extraordinary efforts, and continuing to celebrate three gold medals and the double gold for both the men's and women's teams. And certainly not to detract from it with a tasteless joke.  Trump: "Must invite the ladies" After the men's Olympic gold in ice hockey, they were invited to the White House over the phone in the locker room. Then President Donald Trump took the opportunity to make a sour joke. - We will have to invite the women's national team as well, just so you know, said Donald Trump and laughed: - Otherwise I would be impeached. The women's national team declined the invitation, citing logistical reasons and schedule conflicts. So it was the men's national team that had to receive the applause of Congress when Donald Trump gave his annual "state of the union" speech on Wednesday.  Laughter at the president's joke Several hockey players laughed at the president's joke in the locker room. But player Jack Hughes emphasized that the relationship between the teams is good. - You are in the middle of the moment and the president calls. We play the music at maximum volume. It is what it is, he says. - We have so much respect for the women's team and they have just as much respect for us. We're all just proud Americans.  Women's team captain Hilary Knight tells ESPN it's a shame how the situation turned out.  - I think the guys were in a difficult situation, so I think it's a shame that this story and narrative has been inflated and overshadows that community and the genuine interest that we have for each other.  Goalkeeper from the men's national team, Jeremy Swayman thinks the players should have reacted differently in the locker room. - To be able to share that gold medal with them is something we are forever grateful for, he says.

## Threats to the entire Nordic region are being investigated: "Can strike in the near future"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-26 (today)

A number of authorities and police units throughout the Nordic region are said to have gone on alert. According to information to TV4 Nyheterna, a threat image from an actor, who is believed to have connections to a foreign power, has been directed at the energy grid in the entire Nordic region, including Sweden. According to TV4 Nyheternas sources, the threat image is to be taken very seriously and described as sharp. A number of Swedish authorities have joined a joint international effort and are actively working on the matter. At the same time, the police around Sweden have received orders to monitor socially critical activities connected to the energy supply, according to the same information. - Police officers on external duty have received sharp calls from the top management to take this seriously and to be vigilant and note all deviations. This is intensive work that is ongoing, says a source to TV4 Nyheterna. The threat actor must have stated a deadline before striking, according to information. It is unknown to TV4 Nyheterna how the attack will be carried out or further details of what the threat consists of. - According to the threat, the actor may strike in the near future, says an informant. The police withdraw the confirmation: "Following the situation actively" Swedish police confirmed on Thursday morning that they had received information about a threat to the Nordic energy infrastructure. - We know the data, actively follow the situation and collaborate with relevant actors. We refer to the Agency for Civil Defense, MCF, or the Energy Agency, said Karin Styrenius, press spokesperson at the police's national media center. The Swedish Energy Agency stated that they "received some information about this" but referred to the Norwegian Defense Radio Agency, FRA. MCF also confirmed the threat picture but referred to FRA. - We know the data, follow the situation and cooperate with relevant actors. We refer interview requests to FRA, said Anna Wennerström, press officer at MCF, formerly MSB. Later on Tuesday, the authorities stated that they investigated the information more closely and that it is not a specific threat but is about a "g

## Orbán rages against Zelenskyj: "Tried to force us into the war"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-26 (today)

On Thursday morning, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán published an open letter to Zelenskyj on X. In it, he furiously attacks Volodymyr Zelenskyj, calling his policy "anti-Hungarian". "For four years you have worked to force Hungary into the war between your country and Russia," he writes. "We also see that you, Brussels, and the Hungarian opposition are coordinating efforts to bring a pro-Ukrainian government to power in Hungary." "No responsibility for Ukraine's situation" Orbán also criticizes that Ukraine has not repaired the Druzhba pipeline that runs through Ukraine and carries oil between Russia and Hungary. According to Orbán, Ukraine is "blocking" the pipeline, but according to Kiev, the Russians have blown up the pipeline and Zelensky has previously said that it is being repaired as soon as possible, according to Reuters. "We, the Hungarian people, have no responsibility for the situation Ukraine is in. We sympathize with the Ukrainian people, but we do not want to participate in the war. We do not want to finance the war and we do not want more expensive energy prices. More respect for Hungary!", concluded Orbán. Hungary will soon go to the polls On April 12, Hungary will hold elections.  For the first time in 16 years, Orbán's national conservative Fidesz party has a real challenger in liberal conservative and pro-Ukraine Péter Magyar.

## The pike got stuck in Johan's son's hand - under the ice: "Panic"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-26 (today)

A fishing trip on Mälaren's ice quickly became an unpleasant experience for Johan Bertlid and his son Arvid. They were going to fish for perch but managed to get a pike on the hook. The fish had gotten the hook in the side and could not therefore be brought up through the hole in the ice. - Then I first thought that we should drill a hole next to the old one. But then Arvid thought it wasn't necessary, we had done that before. Then he ran his hand down there, but the ice was so thick. Just as the hand came down, the pike was there, and then the hook was in the hand, says Johan Bertlid. They were about a kilometer out on the ice and fought for over ten minutes to get Arvid's hand up. Johan's youngest son Bo finally drilled seven holes around Arvid's arm. - So we got the whole lump of ice, Arvid's arm, the bait and the pike, says Johan Bertlid. Still have problems with feeling in the hand In retrospect they can laugh about the incident but in the moment it was panicky. - So hopefully people can learn that you should bring a grappling hook or make bigger holes and absolutely not go out yourself if you have to land the fish in that way, says Johan Bertlid. - He has problems with sensation in his thumb and index finger.  They threw the pike back into the lake and they are not afraid to go out fishing again. - We are going out today, as soon as it stops raining.

## Smart trick in the mountains: This is how you fool the thief - in two seconds
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-26 (today)

The sports holiday week is here - and with it, many families with children are on their way to Sweden's ski resorts. When pressure increases on slopes, restaurants and accommodation, more opportunities are also created for thieves to attack expensive ski equipment. Paul Pintér at Stöldskyddsföreningen believes that the problem is not necessarily that more thefts occur - but that the sports holiday means more opportunities for the thief, something that P4 Gävleborg also previously reported on... - The opportunity makes the thief. The more people moving on the slopes and in the restaurants, the more chances to grab something that is unattended, he says. Simple changes Pintér describes how the behavior of skiers changes when they get to the mountains. Many become less vigilant – precisely because everyone else seems to be too. - There are many people who think "no one will take my things". You see jackets hanging everywhere and skis stacked outside the restaurants. But when there are a lot of people on the move, you can get rid of things very quickly. It is easier for a thief to hide in the crowd than when everyone is aware, he says. Expensive gadgets attract thieves Once thieves strike, the target is clear: equipment that can be resold. - Nice, new, expensive skis. Something that has a good resale value. They are the most attractive, says Pintér. Even ski jackets and other equipment can disappear when left unattended in drying rooms, closets or on hooks. The super tip When it comes to actually preventing the skis from being stolen, there's a trick Pintér keeps coming back to - and it stands out precisely because it's so simple. - If you have to leave your skis unattended, tie your skis together with someone else's. The thief wants a complete pair. If they only get a mismatched pair, they can't sell it on, he says. Pintér emphasizes that the trick is not only effective, but also ridiculously simple – so simple that many people don't even think about it. - It's such a simple thing, he says. Paul Pintér also recommends ski enthusiasts to DNA mark their equipment. It did

## DNA matching was delayed - then the triple murder had time to take place
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-26 (1 day old)

Shortly after three o'clock in the afternoon on April 15, there is an alarm about gunfire in central Eslöv. It turns out that a man has been shot inside a residence, and another man out on the street. Both suffer life-threatening injuries but survive. A witness captures on film how the shooter fires three shots in the street. Police technicians later find 13 empty shell casings at that location. Dna on scooter The person leaves on an electric scooter and a few hours later the police find a similar scooter in a nearby park. It is immediately suspected that it is the getaway vehicle and two days later the handle is checked for DNA and sent to NFC in Linköping. The police request priority from the NFC, which means that it must be prioritized before other cases. However, priority or emergency right-of-way is not requested, which can be done if it is deemed particularly urgent.  In the case of urgent priority, answers must be provided within ten hours, in the case of priority, answers can be delivered within a few days, according to NFC. It is not possible to say that it is always done in a certain case, but serious violent crimes where there is a hunt for a perpetrator, they are often seen in these foretours, says Thomas Johansson, press spokesperson for the police in the South region. The priority requested is determined after discussion with the pre-trial investigation manager and the local forensic department in the region, he says. Exactly what was the basis for the assessment in the Eslövs case is difficult to answer due to pre-trial confidentiality. We can't always go in with priority right of way, but you have to make careful balances and assessments about what the conditions are and how it affects, says Johansson. But we always want to be able to seize immediately if we had to decide for ourselves. The previously doomed NFC's response from the topping came on May 6, barely three weeks later. The result was a match in the police DNA register on a previously convicted 21-year-old. When it arrived, he had already been arrested for the triple murder. The police in Uppsala were able to identify him with DNA on clothes that were found in a wastebasket after the so-called

## Here are the companies on the Black List: "Often ignore the rules"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-26 (1 day old)

More companies than ever choose not to follow the General Complaints Board's recommendations and thus end up on Råd & Rön's black list.  - Often we get no reaction from the companies at all. We contact all companies before they end up on the list, so some companies then choose to do the right thing for themselves and pay, says Jonas Ryberg, reporter Råd & Rön. The list is compiled twice a year. On the latest list, there are 388 companies that have ignored ARN's recommendations in a total of 582 cases. - In the update, there are 385 new companies. In total, there are 1065 companies on the list now, it's the first time we've broken the barrier, says Jonas Ryberg. The airlines top the list – as usual The airlines Ryan Air (28) and Turkish Airlines (18), which also topped the list last year, have the most cases, but in reverse order. In third place is the concert organizer Rock Concerts Sweden (11). - Often there are delayed trips and then they have to give compensation according to EU rules, and the airlines don't like these rules so they often ignore them. Why they do it is best answered by themselves, but it is a political position I would say. Because it's not a lot of money, says Ryberg. The company category with the most cases is Motor, where, among other things, the company RM Automobility appears with its eight cases, followed by Bilbolag syd with seven. - Another common industry is tradesmen, and then it's usually about bathroom renovations, solar cell installations and installation of heat pumps, says Jonas Ryberg. You can do that as a consumer If you as a consumer do not get the help you want from a company, you can turn to the General Complaints Board. - That is the first step, hopefully it will be resolved then without having to go to court, which could be the next step. For most people, it might not be worth going to court for a delayed flight unless it's a lot of money. If you still choose to go to court, you can assume that ARN has reviewed your case correctly and that you should

## Slip warning for large parts of Sweden

- There is a warning issued throughout the day. It is then rain and freezing rain that falls on cold roads, says TV4 Nyheternas meteorologist Ingrid Eronn in Nyhetsmorgon. The warning applies from southern Svealand up to southern Norrland, i.e. roughly from south of Karlstad to north of Sundsvall. Since it will be plus degrees in Svealand, it is expected to be slippery in the afternoon, but in southern Norrland it is believed to continue to be slippery until midnight. Those who venture into traffic are asked to drive carefully and adjust their speed. There is also a risk of late or canceled departures in public transport.

## Scientists warn: It's only a matter of time before a new pandemic strikes
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-26 (1 day old)

No one knows for sure how widespread covid-19 is today in Sweden. According to the Public Health Authority, five percent of those who sought care for respiratory infections tested positive in week six of this year. But today no measurements are taken of the entire population and the dark figure is unknown. The typical symptoms such as loss of smell and taste are also not as common. - I think there are those who lose their sense of smell and taste today too. But the symptoms of covid-19 are very difficult to distinguish from a common cold or flu, says Sara Byfors, head of department at the Public Health Agency. When the reports started coming in about a previously unknown virus at the beginning of 2020, Sweden's - and the entire world's - infection control authorities and healthcare were faced with very big challenges. Matti Sällberg, professor and vaccine researcher at Karolinska Institutet remembers when he understood the seriousness of what was about to happen. - It was when Wuhan was shut down. Maybe you can do that in China. But when the same thing happened in New York, then I felt that it was something completely different to what we have experienced before, he says. Fewer seriously ill people Thanks to the rapid development of vaccines and an increasing immunity, the harmful effects of the pandemic could eventually be limited. Today, the risk of becoming seriously ill is much lower. - Fewer people get seriously ill thanks to the vaccines and the fact that many of us have had covid-19 both once and several times. But it is still important that the elderly over 75 and people who belong to risk groups renew their vaccinations, says Sara Byfors. Only a matter of time before a new virus threatens. The virus has also mutated over time and become less dangerous. But that doesn't mean the danger is over.   - It is unlikely that the covid-19 virus would cause a new pandemic. But it is only a matter of time before there is a completely new virus or an old virus that has changed so much that it not only mutates but replaces entire genes. It is important that we have active vaccine research so that we have
