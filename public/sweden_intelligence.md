Big differences between products Among the products that stand out the most in terms of percentage are migraine medicine and medicine for heartburn. A pack of migraine tablets can, for example, cost SEK 20 online but SEK 95 in a store, a difference of 375 percent. Even common medicines such as paracetamol and ibuprofen can be significantly more expensive in stores, especially if they are less well-known brands. Price differences in percentage: When it comes to price differences in kronor, it is above all fever thermometers and food supplements that stand out, as the basic price is already high. For these products, the consumer can save up to SEK 200 by choosing to buy online. Price differences in kroner: "A very good loophole" Johan Wallér, CEO of Sweden's Pharmacists' Association, believes that the fierce competition online puts pressure on prices, while the costs of running the business make it difficult for physical stores to match online prices. - It costs money to have shops at central addresses and to employ pharmacists with extensive training. It is no wonder that it is becoming more expensive, he says. One way to get away with lower prices is to order goods online and choose to pick them up in store - often within a couple of hours. - It is a very good loophole. Then you can choose the price level yourself and still get quick access to the product, says Isabella Ahmadi.

## Sweden tightens its tone towards the US: "It's a crisis of confidence"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-17 (today)

It is in connection with the Riksdag's foreign policy debate tomorrow that the foreign declaration will be presented. And it is a deeper seriousness that will characterize it, the foreign minister tells TV4 Nyheterna, and this applies, among other things, to the relationship with the United States. - It is a crisis of confidence, trust is damaged. But I hope that we will be able to move forward in a better direction, because we must also remember that the United States is important to us and it is also about a broader relationship than just with the Trump administration, says Foreign Minister Malmer Stenergard. Collective sigh of relief The relationship with the United States has taken up a lot of space in Europe after the winter's Greenland crisis. At this weekend's security policy conference in Munich, European leaders breathed a collective sigh of relief when US Secretary of State Marco Rubio refrained from insulting them in a conciliatory speech that nevertheless contained elements of criticism and demands for new path choices for Europe.  And in tomorrow's foreign declaration, the government's tone will be harsher compared to the year before. Then, in 2025, the government decided that Sweden's and the USA's relations are very good. But this time it will be different, Malmer Stenergard asserts: - I probably won't say that. It is a challenging relationship, but it is also diversified. Trust is damaged, but the US is still crucial for us in terms of security, says Malmer Stenergard.

## Parham, 14, risks deportation to Iran: "Don't understand why"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-16 (today)

Farhood and Sara Masoudi came to Sweden from Iran with their children seven years ago. After the asylum application was rejected, the parents had to stay by changing tracks because they worked as cleaners and in home care. Barely a year ago, however, the possibilities for a change of track were scrapped, and then came the announcement of deportation. 14-year-old Parham Masoudi has lived in Norsjö for half his life, loves to play hockey and speaks Norsjö dialect. - I don't understand why we should be deported. Iran is just a name for me, not my homeland. I could live my whole life in Norsjö, says Parham. "Dangerous for us to return" Parham's father Farhood Masoudi says that the family's Christian faith means they cannot return to Iran. - We converted while living in Iran, it is dangerous for us to return, he says. The Masoudi family's deportation notice has sparked interest in Norsjö - one of Sweden's smallest municipalities. The family is considered well-integrated and needed, according to a campaign film in support of the family. - This is the issue that has engaged Norsjö residents the most in all the years I have been a politician. I have been stopped at Ica and Coop by people who say that this is the end of the world, says municipal councilor Mikael Lindfors (S). Municipal criticism of the change in the law Many smaller towns have been critical of the scrapping of track replacement. In C-controlled Laxå, they want to reintroduce the track change and in Lilla Edet, which is also controlled by the Center Party, they want those who are established to be able to be exempted from the rules. S-controlled Finspång believes that those who have not committed a crime should be given a residence permit immediately. Norsjö's Opposition Councilor Lars-Åke Holmgren (KD) is deeply moved by how the family has been affected by the current migration policy. - You have to look at this with tender reasons, it cannot be that everyone should be deported, he says.

## William, 27, was going to throw away rubbish - was met by a close-up fox
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-16 (today)

When William Hermansson, 27, was going out with the garbage outside his home in Borås, he was unexpectedly met by a fox outside the door.  - I was completely shocked, suddenly it was standing half a meter away from me. It was around 8pm one evening last week that it happened. William says he ran and got his phone to film the fox, which was still waiting outside the house.  - I squat down and then it starts nibbling on my hand, as if it thought I had food. "Not natural" It was the first time William caught the fox, but he was never afraid - even though it nibbled on his leg.  - I know it is not dangerous. In the moment I thought "this must be unique, something that many people don't get to be a part of". When the neighbors heard about the discovery, they were impressed. Some have seen it before and reported it, which William thinks is good. - It is not natural that it is in a residential area and is so close. I would think it is looking for food, which could be a problem. It must be able to fend for itself. The municipality does not intervene Henrik Engström at the forestry unit in the city of Borås has seen the film clips. He believes that it is not unusual for foxes to seek out close to people, but that measures are only relevant if they pose a danger. - It happens from time to time, but we only intervene when it is dangerous. If cats start disappearing, we can look into it.  He believes that the fox's curiosity is due to it having been fed before, which he advises against. - I think someone did it when it was young and charming, that's why it's so close.

## Ukrainian successes on the battlefield - fastest in two years
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-16 (today)

This week, Ukraine, the USA and Russia will meet in Switzerland - but in Ukraine the war continues. According to the American think tank ISW, Ukraine has achieved success on the battlefield and regained some ground in the southeastern parts.  Ukraine has launched counterattacks The think tank writes in its latest report that several villages have been liberated in the Dnipro region on the border with Donetsk in southeastern Ukraine. The Ukrainian military analyst Kostyantyn Mashovets, to whom ISW refers, writes on social media that Russia previously achieved certain successes in the area. "However, about a week ago, the Russian advance was severely slowed and almost completely stopped. Ukrainian forces then launched a series of counterattacks," writes Mashovets. The counterattacks are said to have slowed down the Russian offensive and caused several Russian units to withdraw.  "In several sectors, Ukraine managed to recapture villages and push back Russian vanguards up to 9-9.5 kilometers," writes Mashovets.  Despite the successes, Mashovets does not want to call it a counter-offensive, instead he believes that it is about tactical counter-attacks.  Biggest conquest since 2023 The news agency AFP has analyzed ISW's report and believes that Ukraine has reclaimed 201 square kilometers of land, it must have happened between Wednesday and Sunday last week. "The retaken area is almost as large as the Russian gains throughout December and is the largest area that Kiev's forces have retaken in such a short period since the counter-offensive that began in June 2023," writes AFP. The military expert and former lieutenant colonel Jörgen Elfving describes the development as a success for Ukraine.  - It helps to increase the will to resist and that you have something to be happy about. But one should not pull too big gears, there are several sources who believe that it is about local counterattacks, says Elfving. The disappearance of Starlink may have affected Russia Jörgen Elfving believes that the current front section has been quite calm until last fall. When

## Here is the hottest clue - in the hunt for the kidnappers: A glove
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-16 (today)

American presenter Savannah Guthrie's 84-year-old mother Nancy Guthrie has been missing for over two weeks and is feared kidnapped. Last week, the FBI released video footage from Guthrie's residence showing a masked and armed man outside her front door on the night she was last seen. In connection with the release of the video, a glove was found a short distance from Guthrie's home, and on Sunday the FBI announced that it appeared to match the gloves worn by the suspect at the front door. The glove must now be quickly tested for DNA - a process that usually takes about a day. Daughter: "Still Feeling Hope" On the same day the FBI released the information about the glove, Savannah Guthrie posted a social media post pleading with the suspected kidnappers to release her mother Nancy Guthrie. "It's been two weeks since our mother was taken from us, and I just want to say that we still feel hope," says a visibly shaken Savannah Guthrie, and continues: "To whoever took her or knows where she is, I want to say that it's never too late, and you're not lost or alone. It's never too late to do the right thing, and we're here." Savannah Guthrie and her family have pleaded with the suspected kidnapper on several occasions to release Nancy Guthrie. Trump threatens consequences In a brief interview with the New York Post on Monday, US President Donald Trump stated that those who kidnapped Nancy Guthrie will face the "very serious" federal consequences if they do not return her in good condition. Trump also added that he would not be surprised if the Justice Department sought the death penalty. The FBI has previously offered upwards of 100,000 dollars, equivalent to just under a million Swedish kronor, for information that leads to Nancy Guthrie being found and the suspect(s) being arrested. Nancy Guthrie was last seen outside her home in Tucson, Arizona for about 10 minutes

## Here is the new method - to create a new breast after cancer
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-16 (today)

At Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg, the first patient trials with 3D bioprinting are now being prepared.  The technology, which is the only one of its kind, is based on the patient's own fat being collected through gentle liposuction. It is then mixed with a bio-ink and printed into implants in the desired shape. Karin Säljö, senior physician and docent in plastic surgery, sees great potential in the technology: - In the past, you only injected back the fatty tissue you took under the skin, which is a rather poor method. Now a way to control both the volume and the shape is possible, she says. Shorter surgery and better recovery According to the researchers at Sahlgrenska, a major advantage of the technology is that the implants consist of the body's own material. This increases the chance of a natural and sustainable result over time. The process is also expected to be significantly faster for larger reconstructions than with today's method, because both liposuction and bioprinting take place at the same time, explains Karin. - The current method can take five, six hours and also involves a long recovery time. The project has been going on for almost a decade, and only now are the researchers ready to take the next step – to begin trials on humans. The hope is that the first patients will be able to undergo surgery already during the year. The initial tests involve small implants being placed in the subcutaneous fat on the upper arm and then analyzed after a few months. Many patients forego reconstruction Not everyone who loses soft tissue chooses to have it reconstructed.  Within the Breast Cancer Association, there are today women who refrain from reconstructive surgery, even though many would really like to recreate their breast. That's what Susanne Dieroff Hay, president of the Breast Cancer Association, tells us. - Reconstruction is very important for many breast cancer patients, but many wish there were ways to recreate a breast that entail fewer complications, she says. However, the fear of complications is not the only reason why women choose to refrain from o

## The prosecutor's concern in the pimping mess: "There could be more"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-16 (today)

A man in his 60s has been in custody since the end of October last year on suspicion of having forced his wife to sell sexual services to over 120 people. - It was the plaintiff himself who contacted the police at the end of October last year, says chamber prosecutor Ida Annerstedt. The man and the woman are from Kramfors in Västernorrland county, and the man has previously been convicted of violent crime.  How is the woman today? - I don't want to go into that. The concern: "There could be more" The man is suspected on probable grounds of gross pimping. The suspected sex trade must have been going on since December 2023, and the meetings must have taken place both physically and via the internet. The crimes are said to have taken place in Västernorrland County as well as in other parts of Sweden, and several suspected sex buyers have been identified. - Within the framework of the suspicion of pimping, it is primarily physical encounters that are investigated, says prosecutor Ida Annerstedt.  Several of the suspected sex buyers will probably be charged with aggravated pimping. - Other suspected sex buyers will not be covered by this prosecution, but they may be prosecuted later in parallel or separately in their own investigations, says Ida Annerstedt. Risking several years in prison Ida Annerstedt says that she has not been part of such an extensive investigation regarding pimping before, and the risk is that there are more perpetrators who have not yet been identified. - There could be more, absolutely. Investigation is still ongoing. The state of evidence against the man and some of the suspected sex buyers is assessed as good.  - There is, among other things, things that were found in the phones, and then there is also other written evidence and the oral material. There is another type of technical evidence, but a preliminary investigation is ongoing and preliminary investigation confidentiality prevails. The man denies any wrongdoing. If convicted, he faces several years in prison. - It is a bit difficult to say exactly, but it is at least two years according to the penalty scale in any case, says Ida Annerstedt.

## Despite freezing temperatures - the pollen season is approaching
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-16 (today)

This year's winter is significantly colder than last year's and the National Museum of Natural History, which continuously measures the pollen levels in the air, has noted this year that the pollen season has been shifted by a full month compared to last year. Despite that, pharmacies have started to see an increase in the sale of allergy medicine and that many are starting to notice symptoms. How is it possible with pollen in freezing temperatures? One explanation is that pollen gets here with southerly winds from parts of Europe where hazel has already started to bloom, says Agneta Ekebom, pollen expert at the museum. What causes the early pollen season? Climate change has generally led to warmer winters. This means that the pollen season is brought forward when the flowering occurs earlier and earlier. Longer and more intense Liselott Florén at the Asthma and Allergy Association says that the pollen season has also become longer and more intense. How many are allergic? According to the site Pollenkoll, a quarter of the population is allergic to pollen. Liselott Florén says that the number of allergic people in the Western world is increasing.  Florén mentions the two main reasons why it is increasing in the Nordics. When you are exposed to pollen for a longer period of time, the risk of becoming allergic increases. And as the climate down on the continent changes, other types of pollen move up towards northern Europe. Among other things, it concerns wormwood ambrosia, which is very allergenic. It grows in Central Europe and is now beginning to reach our latitudes, she adds. Equip the medicine cabinet What does the pollen season look like in the future? For those who are allergic to hazelnuts, it is good to pay attention to the forecasts and equip the medicine cabinet already now, says Liselott Florén. According to Pollenkoll, hazel is closely followed in time by alder. Next to each other come elm, aspen, birch and willow. Further into the spring comes oak and grass. During the summer, gray nests finally arrive.

## "Much worse than I remember it"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-16 (today)

During its heyday, "America's Next Top Model" had a huge audience with more than 100 million viewers worldwide and a total of 24 seasons were broadcast between 2003 and 2016. In a new Netflix documentary, we get to see the dark side of the program.  - It was much worse than what I remembered when I was younger, when I watched it, says Ellinor Bjurström about the documentary, who herself participated in "Top Model Sweden" ten years ago. Ellinor Bjurström was 18 years old when she was in the Swedish edition of the program. - I have a bit of a love-hate relationship with that time because Top Model Sweden changed my life so incredibly much in many different ways, she says. "Had to stand there in pornographic clothes" There are many events in the program that Ellinor Bjurström finds it hard to think back on. - I remember a photo shoot where we were a girl and a boy as a couple. Then one would be dominant and one submissive. Then we got there and were supposed to wear porn clothes. I was supposed to be submissive so I had to stand there in the porn clothes on all fours against a wall and he was holding a whip, she says. She says that she was far from alone in expressing that several situations were uncomfortable. - But what you forget is that we are there because it is our dream to become models and work with this. We listen to people we look up to and who know the industry. When they say that this is the way it is, you just have to do it or you have to leave, then you swallow your own opinions and feelings and get through it, she says. "It's a shame that I didn't dare to speak up more" When she thinks back to that time today, she wants to give her younger self a hug. - Right then and there, I think it's very sad that I didn't dare to speak up more, while at the same time I feel that I understand myself. I'm strangely proud that I got through it, she says. She says that much of the program was about provoking reactions. - I was, for example, one of those who had little county

Among his classmates who studied under acting guru Sanford Meisner were Dustin Hoffman and Gene Hackman, among others. Collaboration with Coppola There was a long-term collaboration with the director Francis Ford Coppola. Robert Duvall starred in his "Never Love a Stranger" from 1969, in his first two "Godfather" films and also in "Apocalypse now" where Duvall's character is the one who utters the famous line "I love the smell of napalm in the morning". For the role of Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore, he was nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. He was awarded an Oscar in 1984 for his leading role in the western film "På nåd och onåd". After receiving the coveted statuette, he was considered to be affected by the "Oscar curse" and no longer received such interesting offers - while demanding a hefty fee for his efforts. This led, among other things, to him not being allowed to return to the role of Tom Hagen in "The Godfather III" in 1990. Coppola himself told this in the commentary track when the film was released on DVD. Oldest ever During the 1990s and 2000s, an increasingly aged Duvall made many memorable contributions in film and television. Among other things, he received a Golden Globe for his role as Josef Stalin in the TV movie "Stalin". In 2015, at the age of 84, he became the oldest actor ever to be nominated for an Oscar for best supporting actor in the film "The judge". However, the record was broken by Christopher Plummer a few years later. Robert Duvall was married four times, but never had any children. He was active almost to the end, starring in two films released in 2022. Robert Duvall turned 95.

## The top lawyer rages against Iron Maiden shirts in the courtroom
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-16 (today)

Jurors, judges and prosecutors dress more and more casually in the courtroom, according to lawyer Kristofer Stahre.  - They dress terribly badly. I have sat in cases where the client is accused of serious crime and where jurors come in wearing Iron Maiden t-shirts, he says in Nyhetsdagen. He believes that the attire risks undermining confidence in the legal process.  - You shouldn't dress shabby when judging people's lives and this seems to be a huge problem for both judges and prosecutors. I've had prosecutors come into the courtroom wearing thick sweaters with holes in them, says Stahre. - It sends signals that "I don't care" when you come in dressed like a homeless person. The solution: Suits As a solution, Stahre suggests that Sweden introduce uniforms, so-called coats, for legal actors - a system that already exists in Norway and Denmark, among others.  - It is something that is very wrong when news anchors on TV4 are more formally and stylishly dressed than judges and prosecutors who have to handle murders, he says in Nyhetsdagen. - As you probably know, people decide what they think of a person in just a few seconds, so I think it is important for trust in the judicial system that you dress completely and cleanly.

## The bitter cold is leaving - then milder weather is expected
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-16 (today)

In the last month, an unusually severe cold has been over the whole of Sweden with very low temperatures. But at the weekend, the turn comes. A low pressure with snow and rain moves in over the southern parts of the country. In connection with this, the temperatures can go from many minus to a few plus degrees.  - What is happening this week is that the high pressure is starting to weaken and the weather is changing to a large extent, says Madeleine Westin.  Finland gets to take over the cold The long-term high pressure that has kept the cold air is now being pushed east towards Finland, which means that milder air can make its way over Sweden.  - Then moister air from the Atlantic can enter and provide milder weather, says Madeleine Westin.  This means a temporary interruption in the cold mode. In Götaland and possibly also parts of Svealand, temperatures can reach several plus degrees. Can produce large masses of water. There is no question of any more extensive or long-lasting heat. - However, the prognosis is still quite uncertain, says Madeleine Westin. When the weather gets warmer, the snow that has been in the country for a long time can have major effects.  - The cover can bring with it both slippery road conditions and large masses of water when the snow melts.

## Here the minister takes off with the electric plane: "I'm shocked by how quiet it is"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-16 (today)

On Monday, several types of electric aircraft were displayed at Bromma Airport in western Stockholm. One of those who was there to look at the aircraft was Infrastructure Minister Andreas Carlson (KD). He describes e-flight as a "game changer" for the transport sector and accessibility in Sweden. - I think it is important to see that electric flight is not science fiction that lies far into the future, but that we are on the brink of a breakthrough. Then you need to prepare both the infrastructure and the regulatory framework in order to draw out the opportunities that exist for the transformation of aviation. "It's the draft you hear" During the visit, the minister took the opportunity to take a flight down to Drottningholm in an American cargo plane. It can take upwards of half a ton of cargo, and the producer will also develop a smaller passenger plane for five passengers. - It was a great experience, and you are struck by how quiet it is. It's the draft you hear. Currently, there is no commercial air traffic with electric aircraft, and Andreas Carlson also does not know when it is realistic to count on there being regular traffic in Sweden. - The developers must be responsible for the technical development in detail, but my view is that politics needs to ensure that it does not fall behind, says Andreas Carlson. Not worried about the batteries The Nordic countries have taken the initiative to develop the regulatory framework to enable electric flight lines in and between the countries. It would not only be better for the climate - but also cheaper, says Andreas Carlson. - The route we flew cost about 40 bucks in charging. Despite the advantages, there are some question marks surrounding electric flights. Like electric cars, there is a concern that today's batteries are not sufficient for long transports within the country, and there is also concern about how the batteries will withstand the cold. However, Andreas Carlson is optimistic. - The development of battery capacity is fast, so it is important to both prepare and protect the infrastructure. The government sees great potential in this and that would be ok

## A record number of people apply for an increased return migration allowance
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-16 (today)

On 1 January 2026, the return migration allowance was increased to SEK 350,000 per adult and SEK 25,000 per child. Previously, the levels were 10,000 and 5,000 kroner respectively.  - The grant is aimed at people who voluntarily want to return to the countries they originally come from, said Migration Minister Johan Forssell (M) when the proposal was presented in 2024. In the first month of the year alone, the Migration Agency has received 272 applications, compared to 152 in the whole of 2025. Then only one application was granted. Of this year's applications, 93 came from women and 179 from men. The majority, 170 people, are Syrian citizens.  None have been granted So far, 83 applications have been tried - all have been rejected, new figures from the Swedish Migration Agency show. 55 applicants lacked the right permit and 21 had debts with the Kronofogden or CSN. Others were rejected for other reasons.  According to the Swedish Migration Agency, processing normally takes longer than a month, which may contribute to the figures.  - Checking who has debts with the Kronofogden or CSN is fairly quick and then you get rejected immediately. But to get a positive decision you need to go through several steps, for example visiting the Migration Agency for a conversation, says press communicator Didzis Melbiksis. Forssell: No views Migration Minister Johan Forssell (M) announces that he has no views on how many choose to apply for the grant, as it is voluntary. - The new level came into effect about a month ago, so it is far too early to evaluate it or draw any conclusions, Forssell told TV4 Nyheterna.

## Principal detained for multiple child rapes against former student
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-16 (today)

The police arrested a man late Thursday evening on suspicion of multiple rapes. The man works as a principal at a school in Central Sweden, which TV4 Nyheterna was previously able to reveal. The prosecutor's office has confirmed that he is a school employee. After the arrest, the suspicions against the principal must have strengthened, the prosecutor states. On Monday, he was detained on probable cause, the higher level of suspicion, for several counts of child rape since the summer of 2025 and until February of this year. - It is a shorter period than I would have liked to have him detained for. I had primarily requested that he be detained for rape since the summer of 2024, says the prosecutor who leads the preliminary investigation. - There are several cases of rape, but I cannot comment on the number. "Seized technical devices" The victim must be a girl who was previously a student at the principal's school, according to information given to TV4 Nyheterna. The prosecutor does not want to comment on whether the sexual offenses should have taken place when the principal was on duty or not. - I will not comment on how the parties knew each other and did not or where the acts were supposed to have been committed. It is partly due to the fact that the preliminary investigation needs to be kept quiet, and partly that the plaintiff needs to be kept quiet, says the prosecutor. According to the prosecutor, the detainee denies any crime. - We will hold further interrogations and we have seized technical devices that will be reviewed and analyzed. There have also been investigations where we are waiting for test results. The relevant municipality has asked to come back with a comment after the detention hearing.

## Lova, 7, lives with a congenital heart defect: "It was terrible"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-16 (today)

Lova Vesterlund was only two months old when the childcare center noticed that she was not gaining weight. The family was sent to Gävle hospital and after several examinations it was clear that she had a serious congenital heart defect.  - It was terrible. It felt like someone pulled something from under our feet, says Ingela Eriksson, Lova's mother.  For large parts of her life, Lova has been cared for in hospital, and got to meet many hospital clowns, she says in Nyhetsmorgon. In total, she has been operated on four times, with the first operation taking almost twelve hours. Today she has both a pacemaker and a mechanical valve.  - Now I have a pacemaker up here, says Lova and points to her chest.  In 2024, seven children died Despite her congenital heart defect, Lova lives an active life and moves like any seven-year-old – she climbs, plays and is constantly in motion.  - We usually say that she is more wild than tame and joke that it is her pacemaker that is an extra battery and drives her to keep going, says Ingela Eriksson.  Every year around 2,000 children are born in Sweden with congenital heart defects. According to Kristina Sparreljung, secretary general of the Heart-Lung Foundation, survival has improved greatly in recent decades. In 2000, 39 children with congenital heart defects died. In 2024, the number was seven. - This development has been driven by the technological development that made it possible to find children with severe congenital heart defects already during pregnancy. This means that these children can be received in prepared operating units, says Kristina Sparreljung. "Live now, die later" She states that research has progressed, among other things through the possibility today to see children's hearts in three-dimensional images - something that was not possible just a few years ago. At the same time, there are continuing challenges. 

- Children with congenital heart defects suffer to a greater extent than other adults from other cardiovascular complications earlier in life, says Kristina Sparreljung.  Lova likes to take her medicine with a little vanilla ice cream

## The Bachelor couple has had their second child – born at home
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-16 (today)

Siamak "Sia" Hatami and Isa Jallow met in "Bachelor Sweden" 2022. They fell so much for each other that Sia, who was one of the season's bachelors, chose to break the television recordings weeks before the last rose was supposed to be awarded - to give it to Isa in record time. In 2024, they became parents to daughter Zoe, and now the family has received another addition. On Valentine's Day, they welcomed their second child into the world, a little sister. "The little heart came on Valentine's Day," the couple writes in an Instagram post where they show her off for the first time. Born at home On social media, Isa has previously talked about her plans to give birth at home, and followers have been able to see how the couple prepared their home for a birth. But in week 38, Isa was denied a home birth, she writes to TV4 Nyheterna. "It was a planned home birth. I was initially supposed to go through the program "My midwife" which is regionally funded in Stockholm, but was denied a home birth through them as late as week 38 due to a theoretical deviation, which was known about since week 20. So I was forced to hire a home midwife privately at the last minute," Isa writes to TV4 Nyheterna.  "But it turned out better than I could have imagined anyway. The home midwife was fantastic. We are so grateful and really wish that all women who want and can have the opportunity to have a home birth," she continues.
