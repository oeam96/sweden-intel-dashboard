## Zelensky says: World War III has started
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-23 (today)

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says the country will end the war as the victor. He rejects Russian demands for territorial concessions and warns that Vladimir Putin must face heavy military and economic pressure.  Ahead of the anniversary on Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyi describes Russia's full-scale invasion as the start of a third world war, the BBC reports. - I think Putin has already started it. The question is how much territory he will be able to conquer and how to stop him. Russia wants to impose a different way of life on the world, says Zelenskyy to the BBC. TV4's foreign reporter, Johan Fredriksson, who is in Kiev, believes that Zelenskyj is right in many ways.  - He is right in many ways. What we have been talking about is the dictatorship alliance, it is China, Belarus, North Korea and Iran that more or less actively support Russia in the invasion of Ukraine, says Johan Fredriksson.

- So it is an international conflict with many countries involved, he continues. He emphasizes that Zelensky right now needs international support and attention, and that he therefore highlights this in the interview with the BBC. Rejects demands The interview with Zelenskyi was conducted at the government headquarters in Kyiv over the weekend. Russia is demanding that Ukraine hand over the 20 percent of the Donetsk region it still controls, as well as additional areas in Kherson and Zaporizhzhya and several other cities.  Zelenskyy rejects these demands and believes that it is about more than just land. - I see this differently. I don't just see it as land. I see it as us abandoning—weakening our positions, abandoning hundreds of thousands of our people who live there. I am sure that this "retreat" would split our society, Zelenskyy told the newspaper. Warns of truce Zelensky warns that a truce would give Putin time to recover and continue the war within a couple of years.  According to him, the conflict is not only about Ukraine and Russia, but about h

## This is how Klarna enables the purchase of fake pills: "Seemed authentic"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-23 (today)

79-year-old Peter Smedman suffers from severe osteoarthritis. In his feed on Facebook, something appears that looks like a feature from TV4. A man presented as Nyhetsmorgon's employee Mikael "Soldoktorn" Sandström recommends capsules that are claimed to be able to make Peter "completely healthy in a few weeks". - It seemed authentic. So this gave me hope of finding a very flexible solution to my osteoarthritis, says Peter Smedman. When Peter enters the webshop, he sees something that makes him take the step to go ahead and order the capsules.  - Klarna came up as a payment option. As I have used Klarna before, I thought it was very good. It gave some credibility, he says. That, says former prosecutor Stefan Lundberg, is a central part of the scheme. - It's part of the criminal plan, this for the customer to see the Klarna logo and feel safe, just like Peter did here, and not get any idea that this is fraud. "Prison is a normal punishment" Behind the webshops is a Dutch company that is clearly aimed at Sweden - with Swedish-language marketing and Swedish internet addresses. The miracle pills are sold under several names – including Calm X and Leaf Lab.  Kallafakta's review shows that for nine months Klarna acted as a payment intermediary in the fraud. Klarna's actions may be criminal according to several experts who took part in Kalla fakta's research. - It could be money laundering. It can be aiding and abetting fraud, which can also be serious fraud. This means that prison is a normal punishment, says Stefan Lundberg, former chief prosecutor at the Ecocrime Authority. "Strictly prohibited" In the marketing, the capsules are claimed to be able to cure cancer, epilepsy, heart disease and other serious diseases. Claiming that a product cures serious diseases without approval is strictly prohibited. - No, they cannot cure cancer and they are not approved to treat any diseases, says Martin Burman at the Medicines Agency. He calls

## Hitler's birthplace is being renovated here - to become a police station
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-22 (today)

In Adolf Hitler's Austrian birthplace of Braunau am Inn, right on the border with Germany, a great debate is taking place. The house where he was born, which has recently been a sheltered workshop for the disabled, was bought by the state in 2016 and is now being renovated to become a police station. Ludwig Laher is a writer and member of the Mauthausen Committee Austria, an organization that draws attention to the Mauthausen concentration camp. He is critical of the plan. - A police station is problematic. The police - and this is not a criticism of them - must protect the interests of the state in any political system. They must therefore simply obey the state. Resistance within the police force is a rare phenomenon, he told AFP. "Understand that you want to avoid people using it as a place of remembrance" Ludwig Laher says that other possibilities have been discussed. - An idea that received a lot of support was a "responsibility house", a place where young people from different parts of the world could develop strategies for peace work, international understanding and peaceful relations between people. German Sibylle Treiblmaier, 53, thinks the situation is like a "double-edged sword". - I think the house could have been used better or differently, and I understand that you want to avoid people using it as a memorial to Hitler. That's how it really was in my youth.

## "Then the walls collapsed on me, my mother and my wife"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-22 (today)

Today's massive Russian bot attacks and drone attacks come just days before Russia's giant invasion enters its fifth year. In a residential area just west of Kiev, up to six residential buildings have been crumbled by Russian robots. Ukrainian engineer Denis had to dig out his own family with his bare hands from the ruins of the home. - I slept with my family on the first floor. My little son was close to me, under all these walls. The wall fell on me, my mother and my wife, says Denis Kozlov, who is standing with a large bloody bandage around his head. "I'm in shock" Several other residents also testify to dramatic scenes during the morning. - The baby is approximately six to seven months old and was thrown directly out of the window. Thankfully, everyone is alive; everyone is now in the hospital, says student Alina Varfolomieva. It appears to be a minor miracle that not more than one person was killed in the attack. Neighbor Anton Babenko is almost speechless. - The roof collapsed on mother, straight into bed in the middle of her sleep. It raged, and on dad too. And then they managed to get out of there. I don't understand anything, I'm in shock, he says. "Take the threat from Moscow seriously" The residents are now wondering when the outside world will help stop Russia.  - We live with hope. We want to stay. We will not leave here. This is our country, says Denis Kozlov. He now wants to warn the rest of Europe: - Take the threat from Moscow seriously. You think everything will be okay, but if you have a neighbor like Russia, you have to bet on defense. Support us or it will cost you dearly. We are the ones at the forefront.

## Strikes back at the top: "People can think what they want"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-22 (today)

This morning, Leif GW Persson made an unexpected statement for many about the man who is suspected of illegal threats against the moderate politicians Johan Forssell and Benjamin Dousa: - I support it 100 percent. I have decent finances and can even consider taking his legal costs. I am unreserved on the perpetrator's side, said GW Persson at the time. The criticism was not long in coming. Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard (M) wrote in an X post that he "increasingly showed evidence of a lack of judgment" and "crossed a sharp line". "Now is the time to let GW retire?", wrote SD leader Jimmie Åkesson and believes that GW Persson "trivializes, even encourages threats against politicians". GW: "People can think what they want" Now GW Persson comments on the criticism.  - People can think what they want. Regarding my pension, it is something I will wait for as long as I can, he says. The criminologist believes that the apples outside Johan Forssell's door were not about any threat, but were a legitimate protest against an "unreasonable, racist policy". - It's about children and teenagers being deported to countries they've never been to. When people protest against it, I think it's a sign of health. Considers that Forsell overreacted Reporting the person who left the Hitler apples for illegal threats was an overreaction on the part of Johan Forssell, believes Leif GW Persson. - He who left these apples was completely open about who he was. These goblins don't usually do that. - I have been threatened a lot. If I had received some apples with a mustache at home, I would never have thought of reporting it as a threat. GW also points out that he was one of the few who took Åkesson's side when someone "pushed a certain pastry in his face". He then refers to the incident in 2013 when a woman threw a cake in the SD leader's face and was convicted of molestation. - You can't do that, and that judgment was completely correct, says Leif GW Persson.

## Garbage dumps grow in Havana as the fuel crisis deepens
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-22 (today)

The situation is a direct consequence of the energy crisis that has worsened since oil deliveries to Cuba were stopped. The country is heavily dependent on imported oil, above all from Venezuela, which has long served as an economic lifeline. Following the US intervention in Venezuela and the subsequent blockade of Venezuelan oil, supply has been severely curtailed. The US has also threatened to impose punitive tariffs on countries that continue to sell oil to Cuba – which has contributed to further isolating the country. In an attempt to manage the crisis, Cuba's foreign minister traveled to Moscow yesterday for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. - Our countries have a special relationship that has developed historically. We have always stood by Cuba in its struggle for independence and the right to choose its own path, Putin said after the meeting. Russia has condemned the actions of the United States and promised continued support to Cuba. Mexico has also sent humanitarian aid in the form of food and hygiene items. President Claudia Sheinbaum has said the country wants to continue helping Cuba and is exploring the possibility of supplying oil without suffering US sanctions. UN warns of humanitarian crisis UN chief António Guterres has warned that the lack of oil risks leading to a serious humanitarian situation. The fuel shortage is already affecting the food supply, transport and healthcare. At the same time, the US has made it clear that the goal is a political change on the island. President Donald Trump has said the Cuban government faces a choice and needs to make drastic changes. The Cuban government has introduced several emergency measures to save fuel, including rationing and reduced public transport. But despite the measures, everyday life is becoming increasingly difficult for many Cubans. Power outages are becoming more and more frequent, transport is being canceled and access to food is deteriorating. In the streets of Havana, the mountains of garbage continue to grow – a visible symbol of a crisis that now pervades the entire society.

## The expert warns: "Completely impossible to determine the avalanche danger"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-22 (today)

This season, 99 people have died in avalanche accidents in Europe - so far. It can be compared to the 2024-2025 season, when 70 people lost their lives on the slopes. - You can see that there are very avalanche-dangerous conditions in parts of the Alps right now, and have been recently. Overall, it's a very difficult winter, says Petter Palmgren, avalanche expert at the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency. The fact that there are so many avalanches is due to the fact that it has been both snow-poor and cold. - The snow is very weak. Once new snow arrives, conditions will be optimized for people to trigger avalanches, says Palmgren. Difficult to assess the danger In almost all avalanche accidents, it is people who start the avalanche themselves, says Palmgren. - That is the vast majority. Off-piste skiing or going on a trip beyond lifts and roads and villages and such. Then it happens from time to time that avalanches sweep into areas that should be safe. The weather right now makes it extremely difficult to assess the danger, even for experienced skiers. - The avalanche danger remains because there are such weaknesses deeper in the snow. So even if it's sunny the following days, it's easy for accidents to happen. It is completely impossible to determine the avalanche danger as a temporary visitor, but also very difficult for us who work with it every day. You should think about that. Petter Palmgren's advice to skiing enthusiasts is to simply accept the situation that prevails. - If you go down and see that there is a big avalanche danger, then it is not a day for off-piste skiing at all. On other days, to lower the risk, you can ride flatter. - You have to lower the risk level because now it is difficult. If you go down to the Alps and follow the facility's advice and such, then you will be very unlucky if you happen to encounter anything. If you still decide to go off-piste, find out where the dangerous areas are and avoid them. - Without that knowledge, it's pure gambling. Most of the time, however, you can do the activities you had in mind, just take it

## The police's genius stopped the Olympic bomber: "Be lucky"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-22 (today)

Fires and explosions hit several sports grounds around Stockholm. At the same time, they tried to convince the International Olympic Committee that Sweden was a safe and secure Olympic alternative. But the attacks created concern and headlines both in Sweden and internationally. - We were concerned, of course. It was something we didn't understand what was happening, says Leif Jennekvist in Jakten på sprengaren, on TV4 Play. Several attacks on sports facilities The first attack occurred in May 1997 when the Nacka ice rink caught fire. This was followed by more fires and explosions, including at Lidingö tennis hall and Stockholm's stadium.  Police initially suspected no connection, but as the attacks continued, a pattern began to emerge. - We had thoughts about who could be behind it, but we had no leads at the time.  A decisive gut feeling The day before the decisive Olympic decision, Jennekvist had a stroke of genius when he saw the Olympic symbol Man and Pegasus on a police colleague's shirt.  He suspected that the next attack would be aimed at Millesgården, where the statue stood. Two plainclothes policemen were dispatched and managed to arrest a man with an explosive charge of 4.3 kilos of dynamite in his backpack. - It was lucky, says Jenneqvist about the arrest. The man was later convicted of preparation for serious destruction and arson, but many questions about the wave of attacks remained unanswered. Despite the arrest and the police's efforts, it was not enough to save Stockholm's Olympic dream - and the investigations into the other attacks were finally dropped.

## The taste panel confirms: Here is the frozen pizza that is the best in tests
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-22 (today)

In total, we eat half a million pizzas every day in Sweden. As early as 1947, the Sjöhagen restaurant in Västerås started serving pizza to the 300 guest workers from Italy. Then it took until 1968 before the legendary Bengt Wedholm served pizza at restaurant Östergök and in 1969 the first pizzeria, Pizzeria Piazza Opera, opened its doors in Stockholm. The first frozen pizza was introduced in 1979 and today Sweden is the second best in the world at eating frozen pizza after Norway. The taste panel, consisting of cleaning expert Marléne Eriksson, comedian and actor Isak Löb and food historian Richard Tellström, has tested which is actually the best. They assess appearance, taste and texture. Agree on the bottom line The panel has compared five different Margheritas from five different companies: Lidl, Coop, Ica, Dr Oetker and Tony's. They agreed that Tony's, the only Swedish pizza, was a rock bottom and ended up in fifth place. - This was actually cheese au gratin. A pizza should have melted cheese, but it shouldn't be a hot sandwich, I think. It's not a gratin. It was too much sandwich for me, and no pizza feeling with the tomatoes. It felt a bit pale and half-done, says Richard Tellström. In fourth place was the pizza from Lidl, which Marléne Eriksson only gave two points. - It was very thin. A bit tasteless and way too brittle. It burst when you ate it, says Marlene. The panel disagreed on the rating Ica's pizza grabbed third place, and Isak Löb was very impressed with it - and gave it four plus. - I had to add the plus. It had an incredible tomato flavor. I don't know if they pre-grilled the tomato, but the flavor was the best on it. You can throw in lots of it. I could eat two or three, he says. But Marléne Eriksson disagrees. - There was too much tomato puree taste. It was reminiscent of a sandwich. Not a pizza for me, she says. Coop and Dr. Oetker at the top
 It was tight at the top, but Coop's pizza took second place. It received four points from both Marléne Eriksson and I

## Brighter times are approaching - your sleep will be affected
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-22 (today)

Longer days and more hours of sunshine are now noticeable across the country. In southern Sweden, the day gets about four minutes longer every day, while northern Sweden gets up to eight minutes of change. But the rapid change of light can lead to fatigue.  - There will be a postponement of the circadian rhythm. We get light at the "wrong" times because we become dependent on electric light, says Arne Lowden, light and sleep specialist. Spring fatigue despite more light According to Arne Lowden, the fatigue is due to the brain not having time to adjust to stable hormone levels during the sudden increase. - We lack the hormone serotonin, which is needed for us to function, we know this affects animals as well. When the circadian rhythm is disrupted, alertness and mood are affected. Going to bed and getting up at the same times is a way to reduce fatigue.  - One reason why we do well is because we have regular times, but the fact that we need to use an alarm clock is proof that many people have a skewed circadian rhythm, says Arne Lowden. "A kind of jet lag" The fatigue during the spring can also be due to other factors.  - The pollen season occurs at the same time and makes us extra tired. We are also activated by light, which means we don't get to bed in time, says Lowden. It is also important to shut out the light completely when the sun rises earlier in the morning. - We don't want sunlight in at the wrong times, that leads to a kind of jet lag in the spring, he says. This is how you can feel better Psychologist Siri Helle believes that winter often brings with it a general depression that usually subsides in the spring. - What has been seen is that there is a seasonal moodiness, even in the spring when it gets brighter. The sleep cycle and lifestyle changes, like how we spend our days and what our expectations look like.  She advises to be alert to feelings that appear and to ask yourself what gives joy and meaning in everyday life. - You have to be kind to yourself. Emotions are signals that we need something, like getting out or being more active. When the daylight hours become f

## At least 30 may receive the death penalty: "Trying to spread terror"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-22 (1 day old)

After the protests in Iran in January, when millions of people took to the streets and tens of thousands were shot dead by the regime, several people are now at risk of execution. That's what Amnesty writes. Eight have already been convicted in February, in what Amnesty describes as "grossly unfair" trials where the regime denies the accused access to legal representation and tortures them until they confess. - With the death penalty as a weapon, they are trying to spread terror and break down a population that demands a fundamental change, says Diana Eltahawy at Amnesty. 17-year-olds risk the death penalty In addition to the eight, at least 22 others risk being sentenced to death, among them two 17-year-olds. Now the human rights organization calls on Iran to cancel the verdicts and stop the unfair trials. - The international community must take coordinated global action and make Iran stop using its legal system as an assembly line for executions, says Eltahawy. Fear of a major war On Saturday, there were reports that the US is evacuating soldiers from military bases near Iran. President Donald Trump has previously said he is considering launching a military offensive against the country. The country's UN representative has said it will defend itself like never before if attacked.

## So many children go sledding without a helmet: "Can get brain hemorrhage"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-22 (1 day old)

Children all over the country gather in sledding hills when the snow falls. In Vasaparken in Stockholm, helmet use is common, but not everyone wears a helmet. Many children go sledding without a helmet, even though the risk of head injuries is high. A survey from Trygg-Hansa shows that four out of ten parents state that their children do not use helmets on sledding slopes. There is no requirement for a helmet, but doctors emphasize that protection can be decisive in the event of an accident. Doctors warn of risks In the event of a strong blow to the head, the brain can shake inside the skull. - What happens is that if you hit your head hard, the brain actually shakes inside the skull or inside the skull. And when that happens, you can get tiny microscopic injuries in the brain. Then you can get the symptoms we call a concussion. In the worst case, it could be that you get an injury to the skull bone, that it breaks. And then you can get a brain haemorrhage, says Viktoria Bove, section manager of emergency medical care for children in Solna.  Children's heads extra exposed Children have larger and heavier heads in relation to the body compared to adults. - This means that they have an increased risk in these situations of getting head injuries of various kinds. It is fantastic to go out with the children and enjoy the snow and ice and everything that we have. But it's actually just as fun to go sledding with a helmet as without a helmet. So put your helmet on, says Viktoria Bove. The children themselves are often aware of the risks. The parent Jeanette Gustafsson questions her son, Nilas Gustafsson. - Do you always wear a helmet? 
- Yes. 
- What does mother say if you don't have a helmet?
- Go to the ambulance.
- Yes, then you can go with the ambulance. But can you go sledding if you don't have a helmet?
- No.

## No law for victims of crime - three years after the promise: "Complicated"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-22 (1 day old)

One of the government's central talking points in the policy area of ​​crime and punishment has been the shift in perspective from perpetrator to crime victim.  On International Crime Victims' Day 2023, the Minister of Justice made an attention-grabbing move in which he announced a unified law for crime victims.  But no law is in place, nor does it look like it will become a reality in the foreseeable future. - I'll be honest and say that it has turned out to be quite complicated to achieve it in a really good way. In that case, for the time being, we have chosen to take it from another direction, namely to strengthen the rights concretely in the various parts of the legislation where these rights exist. Instead of a unified law for victims of crime, the government has made a number of efforts to promote the position of victims, points out Gunnar Strömmer. Not top priority Enhanced sentencing is a way for victims to get redress. The government also wants to make it easier for crime victims to get compensation from perpetrators by having the state pay out the money and manage the collection of compensation from the perpetrators. The Crime Victims' Authority has also received targeted funds to shorten the processing time so that crime victims receive their compensation. Anders Alenskär, Director General of the Crime Victims' Authority, believes, as does the government, that a new law is not the highest priority. - For us, it is the rights that are important. Whether they come together in a team or not is not as important. Then there can be both pros and cons. It might be more readily available in a team, but it might be harder to collect it in a team. S skeptical that the law has not been introduced, the Social Democrats, on the other hand, want the law to be introduced. The party only copied the Moderates' model in 2023, but are now skeptical that the government has not introduced the law. - For those who are exposed to crime, the crime itself is only the beginning of a rather upsetting process, where many victims of crime testify to being left quite alone with varying levels of support. This is why there is a need for a Victims of Crime Act such as s

## Families of "martyrs" in Ukraine are given apartments by Kim Jong-un
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-21 (1 day old)

This week, Saeppyol Street was inaugurated by North Korean dictator Kim-Jong-un. It is a street in the capital Pyongyang with modern apartments for families of soldiers who died in Ukraine, writes The Guardian. North Korean television shows a smiling Kim Jong-un visiting the families with his daughter Kim Ju-ae. Promised to support Putin "unconditionally" In recent months, North Korea has increased the amount of propaganda about the war in Ukraine, where "martyrs" have been recognized, including through a memorial in Pyongyang. Kim Jong-un has sent thousands of soldiers and large amounts of military equipment to Russia in recent months. Last week he promised to "unconditionally support" Vladimir Putin's policies. The South Korean intelligence service believes that the neighbor to the north is profiting from participating in the war in Ukraine. On the one hand, they gain combat experience, but they also receive military technical assistance from Russia. Thousands of dead North Koreans 2024 North Korea sent around 14,000 troops to Ukraine, of whom 6,000 have been killed, according to Western sources. According to The Guardian, North Korea's Communist Party will hold a congress later in February where Kim Jong-un is expected to announce his goals for the next five years. Analysts believe that the opening ceremony on Saeppyol Street is a "calculated political move" to be able to send more soldiers to Ukraine, writes The Guardian.

According to P4 Stockholm, the car's owner was at the scene to look at shipwrecks, and forgot to apply the handbrake. No one was in the car in connection with the incident, the police say. - Those who have the car have themselves contacted salvagers and will solve it, so there will be nothing police about it, says police spokesperson Nadya Norton to TV4 Nyheterna. The incident is considered an accident. Unusually low water levels The wreck in question is a 40 meter long warship from the 17th century and has become visible due to the unusually low water levels of the winter. The ship has not been wrecked but sunk on the spot, which means that it is relatively intact.  In Stockholm earlier in February the water level was 60 centimeters lower compared to normal levels. Also in other places in Sweden, and throughout the Baltic Sea, the water levels have been record low due to the winter's high pressure. In Skellefteå a full 80 centimeters lower than normal.

**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna

Canelloni Macaroni has been played after Swedish hockey goals during the Winter Olympics and has become an obvious part of the celebration. The song has received attention both on Swedish television and internationally. The New York Times recently placed it second on its list of the best goal songs, beaten only by a Swiss song. Italian views on the song Italian spectators were asked about their impressions of the song. Several described it as happy and captivating. - Great voices, great acting. Ten out of ten, I think, says Andrea Insom. Another person likes that the 1986 song gives her 70s vibes. - The song is pretty cool, but I only understood the word "women" in Italian, says Julia Kamoffo. Lasse Holm happily accepts the compliments, even if his Italian was not entirely easy for the spectators to understand. - The Italians have always stood for good taste and culture. So they have a clue, says Lasse Holm. Proud and honored Lasse Holm tells us that he is proud that the Hockey Association once again chose his music after "Nu tar vi dem" from 1989. He looks forward to reliving the goals at home in Sweden. - It has been a great honor and great fun, says Lasse Holm.  Tour plans and future Next up is another season of participating in the Diggiloo tour for Lasse Holm. - Possibly Canelloni will appear this year, perhaps in some context. We are very tight-knit in our group, given the song's revival and its patina, so we are talking about maybe doing something really fun with Canelloni this summer, says Lasse Holm.

## How to activate national roaming - in case of crisis or war
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-21 (1 day old)

At high alert, all mobile users in Sweden can now switch to another network, if their own stops working.  The function has been prepared for two years and can be activated in the event of war, conflict or other serious external situations.  - We call, text and use the internet every day and it is important for the authorities to be able to reach out with information, says Minister of Civil Affairs Erik Slottner (KD). Ove Landberg, strategist at the department for preparedness and security protection, explains that the technology is already used when using your phone abroad. In Sweden, the function is used when calling 112. New tool for high alert The measure covers all four national operators: Telia, Tele2, Telenor and Tre. For users, the service is free of charge, but for security reasons it must be activated manually.  - It is to reduce potential risks if very many phones suddenly have to communicate via another network, says Ove Landberg. If the function is activated, a VMA, important message to the public, is sent out. National roaming is one of several measures used in case of high alert and can be activated quickly.  - When preparedness is heightened, the government has a smorgasbord of different tools to choose from, and then the Post and Telecommunications Board makes the decision. If there is maximum preparedness, the operators activate this in principle immediately. Inspired by Ukraine Erik Slottner believes that the changed world situation has made the issue more relevant.  - We have seen in Ukraine how important it has been to stick together during the war and this is crucial for reaching out with information, he says. In addition to Ukraine, Sweden is one of the few countries that has implemented national roaming, as part of strengthening total defense due to the global situation.  - This is financed through defense investments, there is a special pot for this, says Erik Slottner.  He does not want to speculate whether there are plans for more similar ventures in the future. If a majority of the networks were to be knocked out, other measures are taken.  - Then lie

## The new information: Lived a double life - and drew colorful airplanes
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-21 (1 day old)

The 26-year-old has admitted serious breach of public peace but denied the murder of My, who disappeared when she was going to walk home from the commuter train station in Rönninge on the night of Boxing Day. Immediately after the detention hearing, the suspect was taken to a clinic for a forensic psychiatric examination. He was there for over a month, until last week, and the doctors' assessment was that the 26-year-old was not seriously mentally ill. TV4 Nyheterna has now taken part of the investigation behind the assessment. Has an interest in death When the 26-year-old arrived at the forensic psychiatric clinic, it was noted that he had an eye injury that occurred around the time of the arrest, which, according to information to TV4 Nyheterna, happened in the act in a forest. The forensic psychiatrists have since mentioned in their statement that the 26-year-old has an interest in "children and death" after he tried to kidnap a ten-year-old girl unknown to him in 2019. A large amount of child pornography was also found in his computer. The man has undergone a treatment program for sex offenders after the sentence. After the 26-year-old served his sentence, he and his family were subjected to threats and harassment, he says in the psychological examination. He was therefore given a protected identity and has changed his name several times. In 2023, he changed to a female first name after "mostly throughout his life he felt more like a woman than a man". "Living under the radar" After his release, he obtained a truck driver's license and started working in the transport industry. He lost several of his jobs. "In retrospect, (the 26-year-old) has thought about whether the reference to 'lack of work' could be due to other causes," the doctors write after talking to him. Later, he managed to get a job that was the "safest so far" where he was "hired without any real background check." "(The 26-year-old) states that he has managed to "live under the radar, probably due to protected identity information and name changes." Leisure interest: Paintball Läk
