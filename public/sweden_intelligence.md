## The savings expert's happy message: "It speaks for an interest rate cut"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-06 (today)

Swedish inflation has thus fallen below the Riksbank's target of two percent, which may have an impact on future interest rate announcements. According to Frida Bratt, it is above all the strengthened krona that contributed to imports becoming cheaper and thus pushed inflation down. The Riksbank's next step - I think this suggests that the next step will be a decrease rather than an increase. There has been talk of an increase, but now we see that inflation is coming quite far. It comes below the inflation target of two percent, says Frida Bratt. She believes that low inflation partly shows that growth has not picked up, which may lead to the Riksbank wanting to support the economy by lowering interest rates. At the same time, it may take some time before a possible reduction takes place. - Even if the next step could be a reduction, it could take a while. You want to wait and see: Will growth pick up in the Swedish economy and thus also inflation? Inflation measure in focus CPIF excluding energy (KPIF-XE) is often used to give a clearer picture of the underlying inflation, as energy prices are difficult to influence. If energy prices are included, inflation lands at two percent. - You would like to look at what is moving underneath if you ignore the energy prices and count them out, very relevant to look at, says Frida Bratt.

## Today, the verdict comes down against Dumpen: "Arouses a lot of emotion"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-06 (today)

It was a couple of years ago that Dumpen confronted a man who they believed had sex-chatted with a 14-year-old. After being hanged, the man stated that he felt unwell and was unable to work, which led him to sue Dumpen's responsible publisher for gross defamation. - This one is perhaps particularly interesting because Dumpen is very much noticed in society. It poses very big questions at its tip that arouse a lot of emotions, says Ängla Pändel, lawyer and expert on defamation issues. "Quite unique for Sweden" According to a jury, which is used in this type of case, she is guilty. But now the judge must also take a position on the issue and announce the verdict today. In this case, Dumpen can be convicted of defamation regardless of whether the man was guilty of the sex chats or not. - It is quite unique for Sweden that the defamation provision also covers information that is true. But on the other hand, you carry out a type of justifiability assessment, so in some cases it can still be justifiable to spread this type of information if you can show that the public interest outweighs the individual's right to privacy and protection of personal integrity, explains Ängla Pändel.

## Tricked into taking a job as an electrical engineer - risks becoming cannon fodder in Russia
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-05 (today)

After being promised a well-paid job in Russia, Francis Ndung'u Ndarua was instead forced into military service and sent to the front in Ukraine after only three weeks of training. In December, a video was published in which Francis warns other Africans: - You will end up in the military even if you have never served, and you will be sent to the front. Many friends have died for money, Francis says in the video. Viral video shows abuse Soon after, a video of Francis spread on social media. In uniform and with a land mine strapped to his chest, he is threatened by a Russian-speaking person who says that Francis will be used as a "can opener" to advance Russia's positions.  According to CNN, more and more Africans are being lured to Russia with promises of high wages and citizenship. Twelve African soldiers from Ghana, Nigeria and Uganda, among others, tell CNN that they were promised civilian jobs, but once in Russia have been forced to sign military contracts in Russian without an interpreter.  Many have had their passports confiscated and have not received any salary. - I have been here for seven months and have not received a cent, says one soldier anonymously to CNN. A soldier CNN spoke to believes that the African soldiers are given the most dangerous assignments at the front. - When you have stepped into the Russian army, you will either flee or die, says recruit Patrick Kwoba to CNN.  African governments warn Several African governments, including in Uganda, South Africa and Kenya, have warned that their citizens are being tricked into the war.  Ukraine's ambassador to Kenya, Yurii Tokar, also calls on African countries to stop recruitment.  - If they are at the front, they are our enemies, and Ukraine will defend itself. This recruitment channel must be stopped.

## Jagland is being investigated following revelations in the Epstein files
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-05 (today)

Between October 1996 and October 1997, Thorbjørn Jagland was Norway's Prime Minister as party leader of the Labor Party. He has also served as secretary general of the Council of Europe and as chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee.  Now Norway's ecocrime authority has decided to investigate him, following suspicions that he was guilty of ecocrime in his contacts with Jeffrey Epstein. - We have decided to start an investigation against Thorbjørn Jagland, says Pål K. Lønseth, head of the Norwegian Ecocrime Authority, to NRK. More specifically, they are investigating whether Jagland received gifts, trips and loans while he was chairman of the Nobel Committee and secretary general of the Council of Europe. Want to waive immunity There is, however, an aggravating circumstance. Jagland has immunity for his former role in the Council of Europe. The ecocrime authority now wants the Norwegian Foreign Ministry to lift that immunity, reports Dagbladet. "Because Jagland has immunity as the former head of an international organization, Ekokrim has asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to take the initiative to lift the immunity," the authority writes in a press release. Norway's Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide agrees with the Ecocrime Authority that Jagland's immunity must be lifted. - It is important that this issue is clarified. Then Jagland's immunity cannot stand in the way of an investigation. I have therefore decided that Norway should present a proposal to the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers that Jagland's immunity should be lifted, says the foreign minister. Taking the investigation in stride Thorbjørn Jagland's defense lawyer, Anders Brosveet, however, takes the accusations against his client in stride. He tells VG that they will cooperate with the investigation and submit the requested documentation. - And based on what we have found, we are calmly looking at the outcome. It is first and foremost good for Jagland to get an authoritative clarification from Ekokrim, rather than the entire press corps carrying out its own little private investigation, says Brosveet.  Emails in the latest Epstein files show, among other things

## More and more people are asking AI for dating advice - the psychologist: You should think about that
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-05 (today)

According to an American study, one in four singles in the United States, and almost half of Generation Z, use AI to, among other things, analyze messages when dating online. One of those who use AI as a springboard in their dating is Dilara Chakali. - When I went to therapy, I felt: One hour a week was not enough for me. I wanted to reflect more. I wanted to understand myself more, how I function in dating, says Dilara Chakali in Efter fem. "Not so strange" Dilara Chakali says that she uses AI to get straight answers, but emphasizes that it is she herself who decides which advice she takes to heart. - I want "the ugly truth", she says.  - Then of course I choose how I act on it. I want to believe that I have the self-awareness that I don't act on everything it says, she says. Psychologist Maria Farm believes that it is a natural human behavior to ask for advice. And in this way, it is understandable that more and more people are using AI in these matters. - I think it is a natural consequence. That it is there and that we also use it in psychological matters, I don't think that is so strange in itself, says Maria Farm in Efter fem. The psychologist's advice: See it as a supplement Farm sees no major problems with using AI as support, but urges you to ask yourself the question for what purpose you are asking a question, as it can become destructive in the long run if you constantly have to ask and cannot make decisions yourself. - I have many clients who are a bit anxious, full of anxiety and they sometimes need to practice not actually asking so many questions about it, it could be the relationship, but it could also be their own health.  - With me, they get to practice standing up for their own opinion or maybe not asking for completely certain answers all the time, adds Farm. Maria Farm recommends that AI be used as part of a larger palette when it comes to big decisions in life. - If you are thinking about something as big as divorce, also ask a person. It doesn't have to be a therapist, but some wise person you trust

## Former Miss Snusk throws the mask: "Big step"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-05 (today)

Pandemic fashion gets a renaissance in Melodifestivalen when Felicia, who still hides half her face, constantly matches the mouthguards with her clothes. During her performance she wears a black lace mouthguard, at Thursday's press conference it is leopard print. I can't drink anything, I'm very thirsty, she says, glancing at the water bottle on the table. That the artist now shows the eyes and forehead is a big step and has required a lot of work with self-esteem, says Felicia. The dream is to be able to eat at a restaurant with her team without "panicking", as she puts it, but there is still a long way to go. Basically, I haven't shown my face to anyone since 2022. Then it will be so scary to say "hey, here I am". So I am very proud that I dare to do this, she says. At the end of the performance with the song "My system", she actually throws off the mask - but immediately replaces it with a pair of silver sunglasses. Instead of feeling like I'm getting completely naked, I take one step at a time, and I ended up wearing glasses, she says.

## Magdalena Andersson's message: This is how we want to govern the country
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-05 (today)

The S leader believes that today's organized crime still requires tougher punishments, where the party wants to introduce special legislation against gang leaders - inspired by American mafia legislation. At the same time, the party leader emphasizes the importance of breaking new recruitment into gang crime. - You can put any number of gang criminals behind bars if only new generations come. Then it's a matter of spotting young people who are slipping, says Magdalena Andersson in Efter fem.  Open for cooperation - but not with SD The government issue looks to be complicated after the election, according to Andersson. She rules out cooperation with the Sweden Democrats, but is prepared to negotiate with other parties. - My ambition is to form a government led by social democrats. I am prepared to cooperate with all the parties except the Sweden Democrats, says Magdalena Andersson. The S leader has previously expressed that she is open to a collaboration with Ebba Busch (KD). In Efter fem, Magdalena Andersson says that you can cooperate between parties, without sitting in government together. - Take energy policy for example, where it is quite obvious that there is an opportunity to agree quite broadly. And you can do that without being in the same government, says Magdalena Andersson. The working hours issue is not an election issue Today, the Left Party announced that it demands an investigation into shortened working hours in a possible government negotiation. Magdalena Andersson sees the message as "unfortunate". - Now that the workers want to try to resolve this in negotiations, it is unfortunate if political parties go and say that they want to take it through legislation instead, says the party leader. When asked if the Social Democrats will make shortened working hours an election issue, the S leader replies: - No, we think it is good that LO has made this election. We support them in their ambition to be able to negotiate this with the employers.

## The demand: Canada should choose the Jas Gripen
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-05 (today)

Don Davies, who is acting party leader of the Canadian Social Democrats, is now demanding, together with Canada's Green Party, that the purchase of the F-35 be scrapped. The Jas Gripen is a far better and more cost-effective alternative, it is believed.  The proposal by Saab to sell the Jas Gripen to Canada should be adopted immediately, Opposition Leader Davies said at a press briefing in the Canadian Parliament in Ottawa last night, underlining that the situation is serious. Reduced dependence on the United States The play is done against the background of Canada's decision to expand its air combat forces with 88 new planes. 16 of these, F-35 Lightning from American Lockheed Martin are already booked and ordered. But there is now an intense debate about the remaining 72 combat aircraft; which plan to choose? Concerns about the reliability of the United States as a partner have grown in Canada following Donald Trump's repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state of the United States. The opposition now also points out that Prime Minister Mark Carney himself in his famous speech in Davos recently emphasized that Canada must act more independently and reduce its dependence on the United States and invest more in cooperation with medium-sized countries. 

- If Mark Carney completes the purchase of the F-35, it proves that his statements in Davos were just a PR stunt, says Don Davies. Saab hopes for production line Yesterday's marking from two of Canada's opposition parties comes at the same time that Saab announced at the Singapore Air Show that the defense group is considering establishing a production line in Canada that can serve not only Canadian needs but also build Gripen planes for other countries. - If we were to win in Canada, we would not only build for Canada. We would see it as a hub for exports, said Mikael Franzén, head of marketing for Saab's Gripen program at the Singapore Airshow yesterday. He also said that Saab hopes for a production rate of 36 Gripen E/F aircraft per year by utilizing more than just the current production countries Sweden and Brazil. An opinion poll recently

## Crisis meeting at the County Administrative Board - has silenced employees
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-05 (today)

The suspected environmental scandal at the County Board in Norrbotten became known on Tuesday when TV4 Nyheterna could reveal that a preliminary investigation into misconduct was underway. The criminal suspicion is that the authority should not have reported almost 200 possible environmental crimes to the police. According to information to TV4 Nyheterna, the events are mainly linked to LKAB, SSAB and Boliden Mineral. A prosecutor from the National Anti-Corruption Unit is investigating the suspected misconduct together with the police's anti-corruption unit at Noa, the national operational department. Lotta Finstorp, governor of Norrbotten county, commented on the suspicions yesterday. - These are very serious allegations. I am now waiting to receive a signal from the police and prosecutors to be able to know exactly what this is about. My information is based on what you have reported in the media, she said. Today, the County Administrative Board in Norrbotten called the staff to an extraordinary meeting due to the disclosure. "Requested employees not to talk to the media" "That's right. Your reporting has raised questions among our employees and we informed you that we currently do not know more than what you have conveyed. We hold regular information meetings with all employees with the aim of keeping everyone updated on the operations. We also hold such if necessary between the regular information meetings, which we carried out today," writes the authority's head of communications Fredrik Hedlund in an email. Sources from within the County Administrative Board state that during the crisis meeting, management urged the agency employees not to speak out if they are contacted by the media, but instead to refer to the communications department. According to Fredrik Hedlund, the purpose was "not to urge employees not to talk to the media" but to inform the employees to contact the communications department "for support". - Maybe that's what they meant, but that's not how it was said, says an employee at the County Administrative Board to TV4 Nyheterna. The prosecutor who leads the misconduct investigation does not want to comment on the case.

## Starmer is undergoing his deepest political crisis yet
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-05 (today)

The apology was made at the start of a speech that was supposed to focus on investment in disadvantaged local communities, one of Labour's heart issues. However, it is clear that the Epstein scandal has now reached Starmer's absolute closeness, which means that other politics end up in the background.

Anyone who follows British politics is used to loud headlines, fierce debates in the House of Commons and frequent ministerial changes. Now, however, everything revolves around the question of what the Prime Minister actually knew when Mandelson was appointed to the prestigious ambassador post in Washington.  In the House of Commons yesterday, Starmer admitted he was aware of Mandelson's contacts with Epstein after the 2008 conviction. But during the pre-appointment security clearance, Mandelson claimed he barely knew Epstein - a lie that led to his sacking over a dawn phone call on the US east coast last September.  Demands for publication In the House of Commons, demands are now growing to publish the documents that show how Mandelson was investigated before his appointment. Starmer supports the demand, but the police - who have opened a preliminary investigation against Mandelson - have stopped publication for the time being. Frustrating for the Prime Minister, to use his own words from today's press conference.  Starmer assures that he had absolutely no information about the close relationship between Mandelson and Epstein that he has today. Perhaps the Prime Minister of Great Britain should ask himself how the security clearance for one of the heaviest assignments in the foreign administration is done?

Documents from the US Department of Justice, consisting of both emails and photos, testify to close contacts between Epstein and the British heavyweight.  That Mandelson appears in the picture in old white underpants in Epstein's apartment in Paris is in this context a minor detail; significantly more serious is that he shared market-sensitive information and gave Epstein insight behind the scenes into London's political top echelons, including during the coalition negotiations in 2010.

## Åkesson skips pure race – after threats
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-05 (today)

Sweden Democrats party leader Jimmie Åkesson is in Jokkmokk to visit the annual market held in the town. In connection with the visit, Åkesson had planned to participate in the traditional reindeer race, but the SD leader needed to think again. According to information to TV4 Nyheterna, Åkesson skips the competition at the request of Säpo. "Heard it was a revolver" Several politicians on site have been informed of an "incident" by the authority. The party leader tells TV4 Nyheterna that he learned that someone dropped a weapon-like object near him. - I heard that it was a revolver or a pistol, says Jimmie Åkesson. The police write on their website that they have information about a weapon-like object, but that it must have been picked up and that one or more people must have left the scene. The police have not yet found any weapon. At first there were reports that politicians had been threatened, but the police deny this. Säpo denies Säpo's press service does not want to go into whether they warned the SD leader about a firearm. - Our dialogue with our guardians is not something we can go into, so I cannot say anything about it. It is part of the protection itself, says Säpo's spokesperson Johan Wikström. The Sweden Democrats' press department cannot confirm whether Åkesson has received threats. - The information I have is that he is not running, and it is after a recommendation from Säpo, says party spokesperson Emma Kareld. It is not the first time Jimmie Åkesson has had to leave Jokkmokk's market. In 2014, his book signing at the market was stopped due to threats, which SVT Norrbotten reported on at the time.

Both Daniel Zdolsek and Petter Åkerman are nominated in the category "TV abroad". - It's always fun to be nominated, says Petter Åkerman. Zdolsek is nominated for a feature on the increased violence and harassment against Palestinians by extreme settlers in the West Bank, and Åkerman is nominated for a feature on New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani. Both features are made with reporter Filip Jacobsson. - It is an honor, but it is Filip who should have the credit for the idea for the feature, says Petter Åkerman. Celebrating the aesthetic quality Daniel Zdolsek also highlights reporter Filip Jacobsson. - The fact that we are nominated says something about the fact that we have reporters who care about the aesthetic expression and quality, and that we have been seen so much in recent years. It says something about where the channel stands in terms of quality compared to the competitors - I think we are far ahead of everyone else. It's fun, says Daniel Zdolsek and adds: - TV4 allows you to develop and express yourself aesthetically and visually qualitatively during the work shifts, which I value.

## Nuclear weapons agreement expires - warns: "May increase the appetite of others"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-05 (today)

When the nuclear agreement between the US and Russia now expires, for the first time in over 50 years there are no restrictions on the world's most destructive weapons. According to Jakob Hallgren, director of the Foreign Policy Institute, there is a great risk that a long period of disarmament will now stop – or reverse. - This is the first time since the early 1970s that there is no agreement regulating the number and use of the most powerful nuclear weapons between the two countries that have the most in the entire world, he says. Regulated the most dangerous weapons The agreement that is now expiring has been about limiting strategic nuclear weapons, above all intercontinental missiles that can be fired from the US at Russia - or vice versa. In recent decades, these agreements have led to a sharp reduction in the world's nuclear arsenals. - During these 50 years, they have gone from a maximum of 70,000 nuclear weapons down to 12,000 today. It is a result of successive reductions that are now stopping – or, in the worst case, reversing. According to Hallgren, the risks already exist today. One of the biggest problems is that the US and Russia can no longer agree on new agreements. Today, China is estimated to have around 600 nuclear weapons, but Hallgren points to information which claims that the country may be on its way to 1,000 or 1,500. - China is now the factor that makes it impossible to come to an agreement. The US has said it wants China on board, but the Chinese say no. Increased tensions - also in Europe When there is no agreement that regulates the most devastating nuclear weapons, tensions in the outside world also increase, says Hallgren. The expert emphasizes that even a limited use of nuclear weapons would have extreme consequences. - Even the smallest nuclear weapon would have completely devastating effects, with hundreds of thousands - if not millions - of people injured or killed. There are terrible effects of nuclear weapons. At the same time, there is still the so-called non-proliferation agreement, which came into force at the end of the 1960s and aims
