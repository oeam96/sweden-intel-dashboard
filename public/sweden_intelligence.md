## Swedish rescue leaders practice - for the worst
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-21 (today)

In Skövde, the rescue leaders are placed in a simulated war situation where they have to deal with a missile hit against a school. The scenario is based on real events from Ukraine and aims to train on complex and extreme situations that cannot be reproduced on a regular training ground. The virtual environment makes it possible to move freely and interact with both people and the environment. Researchers from the University of Skövde are behind the project. So far, roughly 120 rescue officers around the country have been able to try out the concept, which is based on computer game technology where the situation can be updated in real time depending on which decisions are made. Authentic drone images from Ukraine To increase the realism, authentic drone images from a school in Ukraine are used, where the emergency services inspected the building from the inside using drones. Cecilia Hammar Wijkmark, researcher at the University of Skövde, explains that the project focuses on creating a realistic feeling in the exercise. - We look a lot at what contributes to the feeling of presence, what gives a realistic feeling in this event. It can be everything from the visual elements, sound and interaction with the technology, she says. Provides important experiences Pär Hagbohm believes that although the physical feeling of touching things may be missing, the exercise provides important experiences for the management function. - I think there may be a certain lack of being able to physically touch things. But here we actually isolate the management function of training and decision-making. Here, we get to see so many aspects of this particular thing with the management perspective and leading and making decisions, he says.

**Outlet:** Dagens Nyheter (DN)
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-20 (today)

Chemical castration is an effective treatment against pedophilia - but not a comprehensive solution against sexual crimes. That's what researcher Christoffer Rahm says after the Social Democrats also supported the proposal to castrate pedophiles on parole. - You can't put all your faith in a medicine, says Rahm.

But if you look more closely, you soon see that the disadvantages weigh more heavily. Nuclear weapons do not make us safer - they make us more vulnerable, writes July Decarpentrie, doctoral student at the Norwegian Defense University.

## Ulla-Lena still has unknowns written on her: "Exposed to danger"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-20 (today)

In connection with Ulla-Lena Lindqvist becoming a widow, she bought a summer cottage in Vidja outside Stockholm in 2013. - Then this would be my new little place where I could be and relax and really have a good time, said Ulla-Lena in an interview with TV4 Nyheterna in December. But in 2023, unknown people began registering at Ulla-Lena's cottage - hundreds of people who have no connection to the house.  - I usually describe it as being part of an ongoing burglary, because that's how it feels. I almost always have to be prepared for people to show up, says Ulla-Lena Lindqvist. "The Tax Agency puts me in danger" Ulla-Lena has turned to both the police and the Tax Agency, but she got no help there. In the end, she sued the state for violation of the European Convention together with the Center for Justice. In connection with that, Elisabeth Svantesson (M) was called to the tax committee, and said that she would discuss a solution with the Tax Agency. Now two months have passed and nothing has happened – 66 people are still written to Ulla-Lena's address.  - I believe that the Swedish Tax Agency exposes me to danger, she says. Today, an interpellation debate took place in the Riksdag regarding Ulla-Lena Lindqvist's case, and she was able to meet Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson (M). - It sounded like she was thinking of taking action and contacting the Tax Agency quite immediately. And we gave her suggestions that you can remove my addresses already today or tomorrow without changes to the law, says Ulla-Lena. The Minister of Finance ducked interview Ulla-Lena Lindqvist is not alone in being affected by incorrect bookkeeping. The Swedish Tax Agency annually receives around 20,000 complaints from people who have discovered that someone else is registered at their address. - For Ulla-Lena, it is a clear problem that many people subscribe to her address and use her summer cottage as a mailbox for criminals. It is completely unacceptable that it is tolerated and that the Swedish Tax Agency does nothing about it, says Fredrik Bergman Evans, che

## Trump wants to make public documents about extraterrestrial life
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-20 (today)

The statement from Trump comes after former President Barack Obama said in a podcast interview that aliens exist but that they are not at Area 51. This prompted Trump to react, saying that Obama's statement is against laws and regulations. Obama, according to NBC News, later clarified his statement, saying that "the odds are good that there is life out there." Thousands of reports at the Pentagon Trump refer to the fact that there is a huge public interest in getting access to these documents, as a justification for the decision to make the documents public. The question is what the UFO files will include and Clas Svahn, chairman of UFO-Sweden says that there is a lot of interesting material in the documents. 

- Aro, the Pentagon's UFO office, has said that there are reports they have received in recent years that defy their explanations. Aro has over 2,000 reports that have come in over the past few years, many from US pilots and defense facilities. There can be exciting things there, he says. 

Svahn goes on to say that among the most talked about events is the so-called Tic-Tac incident off the coast of California in 2004, where pilots observed an object that moved in a way that could not be explained.

- Two pilots see an object that moves like soap in a soap dish which is incredibly strange, I want to see radar material there. "A lot is blacked out like in the Epstein files" Svahn believes that much of the material will be heavily redacted once it is made public. - I think it will be difficult and much will certainly be obscured. It will be like in the Epstein documents, not much will come out. Secret seal protects military technology According to NBC News, Trump has instructed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, other officials and relevant agencies to begin the process. Clas Svahn says that it is common for military reports on UFOs to be kept secret, above all to protect sensitive information about technology and defense capabilities.  - Military organizations in a

## S-toppen's mockery in the Riksdag - compare Sweden with Tottenham
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-20 (today)

Social Democrat Mikael Damberg criticized the government during Thursday's Riksdag debate and compared their economic policy to the English football club Tottenham Hotspur.   - That's not enough. Sweden must not perform like Tottenham. Criticism of the financial policy Damberg's actions have been spread in the international media and met with reactions from supporters. He believes that both Sweden and Tottenham have all the conditions to succeed, but that the results are still lacking.  - It is one of England's most historic clubs - a rich association with a huge arena, loyal and extensive supporter base, everything that is required to be a top team. Nevertheless, Tottenham are currently in crisis. "Wrong decision" Earlier this week, the Fiscal Policy Council criticized the government's economic policy, including for having borrowed for defense at the same time as lowering income tax. Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson (M) replied that the Riksdag had agreed that defense investments should not "crowd out" other investments. - I will never apologize for strengthening Swedish households in a time that is very tough, replies Svantesson to that criticism. Tottenham Hotspur are currently in 16th place out of 20 in the Premier League. Damberg believes that the club has underperformed despite good conditions - just like Sweden. - Through wrong decisions, rashness and short-termism, one has lost direction and stability.

## Dressed up as a lion dancer - caught a thief in the middle of the market
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-20 (today)

A video released by Thai police shows colorful lions dancing at a temple market in Bangkok - a familiar sight during New Year celebrations. What the visitors don't know is that two policemen are hiding under the traditional garb, with their eyes fixed on a suspicious man in the crowd.  The person in question is a 33-year-old man who is suspected of breaking into a local police chief on three occasions in the past month. According to the police, valuables to the value of approximately two million baht - equivalent to more than SEK 500,000 - have been stolen.  The video shows how the lion dancers slowly approach the man before suddenly pouncing, wrestling him down and carrying out the arrest in the middle of the market visitors.  Traced amulets The police state that they have previously tried to arrest the man but failed, because he quickly discovered the police and fled the scene.  By tracking stolen amulets he sold, investigators were able to identify him and chart his movement patterns. The investigation revealed that the suspect frequently visited temples in Nonthaburi, leading to the decision to conduct the undercover arrest at a temple market.  No further information about the suspects or upcoming legal process has been released.

## This is how new mortgage rules should make it easier for young people
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-20 (today)

On April 1 this year, there will be new rules on how much you can borrow for a home. Today the ceiling is 80 percent of the home's value, but in April it will be raised to 90 percent. 

- The reason is that they want to make it easier for first-time buyers to enter the housing market. In big cities, hundreds of thousands of kroner can be required in investment, so it is not so easy to enter the housing market, says economics journalist Frida Bratt.  The downside is that people are expected to become more indebted. The house price is affected by the new rules. There will also be new rules about how much you need to amortize. 
- This applies to those who are highly leveraged, i.e. those who have a loan-to-value ratio that is over 70 percent of the home's value and have a loan that is four and a half times higher than their income. So far you have had to amortize three percent, but that is now reduced to two percent, says Frida Bratt.  More expensive apartments The new conditions are expected to have consequences for housing prices, especially for smaller apartments in big cities.
- These are attractive homes for young first-time buyers and these homes could rise in price because more people now have the opportunity to participate in a bidding process, says Frida Bratt.

## S says yes to chemical castration of pedophiles
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-20 (today)

Due to SVT Uppdrag Granskning's reporting on Swedes who are part of and lead pedophile networks, several parties have proposed that pedophiles should be able to be castrated chemically. Justice Minister Gunnar Strömmer (M) has said that the Moderates want to investigate the question of whether chemical castration should be required for the parole of convicted pedophiles after the election. SD and KD have previously put forward the same proposal. A: "Reasonable" Now the Social Democrats are also behind the idea and thus there is a majority for the proposal. A majority that will likely stand even after the parliamentary elections in September, because the major parties are now united on the issue. - We are positive about it. This is a treatment method that already exists today, and we think it is reasonable that you also connect demands for treatment with also being released from prison, says the Social Democrats' criminal policy spokesperson Teresa Carvalho. In addition to castration, S wants to toughen the punishment for child pornography crimes. The party is also coming forward with two more proposals to prevent pedophile crimes. - The police must be alerted to sensitive activities where there are children if you suspect that there are pedophiles working there, for example at independent schools but also at playgrounds and babysitting and other things, says Teresa Carvalho and continues: - We need to lower the threshold quite obviously for when police and prosecutors are allowed to access computers with secret data reading to secure evidence.

## Dancing and singing at the graves of relatives - in protest against the regime
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-20 (today)

This week, 40 days have passed since the widespread protests in Iran were bloodily put down by the country's security forces. During the week, memorial services were held across the country for the thousands of protesters who were killed. In several places the commemorations have turned into new protests against the regime where slogans against the regime have been chanted. According to the American think tank CTP-ISW, twelve demonstrations in seven Iranian provinces took place on Tuesday. In the city of Abdanan in northwestern Iran, security forces are reported to have fired at mourners at the burial grounds. But the commemorative ceremonies have this time taken on a new character. Instead of religious rituals, including Koran reading, music, song and dance have taken their place.  In videos of funerals now circulating, mothers and fathers urge others to sing and live, clap and dance.  Grief as political resistance Writer and Iranian exile Atefeh Sebdani calls it "resistance in its strongest form". She explains that it's about relatives refusing to let the state own their grief - and turning it into political resistance.  This in a country where the Islamic Republic has long built its legitimacy on martyrdom and ritualized grief, the symbolic rebellion against grief as a means of power has now become clear, she explains.  - At these funerals and memorial ceremonies that we now see, you can seem to see something as bizarre as a party. But just scratching the surface a little, you understand that this is the strongest act of resistance you can see, says Atefeh Sebdani. Risking their lives But it is also about the wishes of the victims themselves - often young people who risk their lives for democracy. - We have seen testimonies, terribly heartbreaking wills that have come out. Video and audio messages where you call your relatives before going out on the street. Where they say promise you won't grieve me. Promise you'll celebrate. - This is an act that I have been so close to wanting to dig into the history books to see about men

## Terrorist suspect was under forced care: "There is a bad feeling"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-20 (today)

It is unclear which organization it is about. The prosecutor's point is that it mostly operates on the internet. - It is about an organization in the violent right-wing extremist environment. I will not go into closer details than that, says Henrik Olin at the national unit for security goals to TV4 Nyheterna.  It is unclear in what way the man is suspected of having been active in the organization.  - A participation offense requires some form of activity. It is not enough to have sympathies or to stand behind an organization, it is about something more than that, says Henrik Olin.  The man has previously been suspected of damage linked to Sweden's security. He was taken in for questioning in the intervening days but was later released. He was detained for five days. According to the prosecutor, the suspected crime of participation in a terrorist organization lasted from November 6, 2025 until he was arrested. - It is a young person, previously unpunished. There is a mental ill-being in the picture that the court decides that a doctor should analyze and look at, says Henrik Olin.  Shortly after he was interrogated by Säpo, he was forcibly cared for in a psychiatric ward, documents that TV4 Nyheterna have seen show. The man appealed the decision to the administrative court, which rejected the appeal.  According to the chief medical officer, the man was judged to suffer from a serious mental disorder and to have an "indispensable need for round-the-clock psychiatric care for observation, investigation and continuous monitoring", the documents state.  He was remanded in custody for five days. "During the period of treatment, information emerged that what was previously interpreted as delusions is actually reality," writes the chief medical officer in his statement. On Säpo's radar In connection with the arrest, the Attunda district court also decided that a so-called small forensic psychiatric examination should be carried out.  The man was arrested and detained on Wednesday. He had then been active in the environments since at least November 6 last year, according to the prosecutor

On December 3, 2024, the then president of South Korea gave an unexpected televised speech in which he pointed to threats from North Korea and "anti-state forces".  He declared a state of military emergency, the country's first in four decades, and ordered the military to surround parliament.  Dramatic images of politicians barricading themselves in the parliament building, soldiers trying to storm it and civilians trying to stop armored vehicles were shared around the world.  Six hours The decision was made without political support and within six hours the National Assembly managed to gather and vote to overturn it. The state of emergency lasted for six hours.  The incident sparked mass protests and was described as an attempt to condone Yoon's power.  Ten days later, parliament voted to impeach him. He was immediately suspended and later formally deposed as well. Long investigation The investigation against the former president continued throughout 2025. Yoon has defended his decisions as necessary to protect democracy. Prosecutors have argued throughout that the president abused his power to neutralize political opponents and circumvent the democratic process.  Yesterday he was sentenced by the court in Seoul to life imprisonment for attempted sedition.  Judge Ji Gwi-yeon found that Yoon sent troops to the National Assembly to silence political opponents who opposed his government.  
- The court finds that the intention was to paralyze the congregation for a considerable period of time, he says.  Saying Sorry Yoon Suk Yeol has called the verdict "hard to accept" but has not said if he plans to appeal. It is unclear when the 65-year-old Yoon may become eligible for parole, but lifers can usually apply after 20 years. Today he says sorry.  "I apologize to the people for the frustration and hardship I have caused them as a result of my shortcomings, even though I have always been determined to save the nation," he said in a statement, according to AFP.

## Warns of the ice on water sources: "I wouldn't have ventured out"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-20 (1 day old)

The Delsjö area in Gothenburg is used as the city's raw water reservoir and water is pumped both in and out of the lakes. After weeks of freezing temperatures, the bodies of water are covered by a solid layer of ice, but appearances can be deceiving. Although the ice looks stable, these types of lakes where the water is regulated can be treacherous. - When the water level changes, the ice becomes weaker. It breaks up. Cracks can appear in the ice and therefore the ice can become dangerous, says Anton El Raai, operating engineer for circulation and water within the City of Gothenburg. Like a hammock In Gothenburg, the municipality has specifically warned against entering the Delsjöarna, but this type of regulated lakes can be found all over the country. It is not enough that the ice itself becomes unstable. If water is drained after the ice has formed, a gap of several decimetres can be created between the ice cover and the water surface. - Then it becomes even more dangerous, because then the ice becomes like a hammock above the water and then you can fall if you feel bad, says Kim Loob Almbratt, biologist at Sportfiskarna. This "hammock effect" on the one hand increases the pressure on the ice when the water does not relieve it, and on the other hand the person who falls through risks getting stuck under the ice without the possibility of climbing up. The expert advises against When TV4 meets Kim Loob Almbratt, he and Sportfiskarna are out with a school class showing things you can do on the ice, such as ice fishing. But they are not out on the Delsjöarna, but have chosen another lake in Gothenburg where the ice is stable. - I wouldn't have ventured out on an ice that has a lot of regulation, nor a water source if I'm not absolutely sure that I will be able to handle this. I don't think common people should go out on regulated lakes, says Kim Loob Almbratt.
