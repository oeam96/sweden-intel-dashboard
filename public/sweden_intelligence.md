## Busch increases the most in new measurement – ​​keys in on Åkesson
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-25 (today)

In the survey for February 2026, Magdalena Andersson (S) continued to have the highest level of trust with 43 percent. Ulf Kristersson (M) follows with 36 percent, then Jimmie Åkesson (SD) on 29 percent and Ebba Busch (KD) on 28 percent.  The distance between Andersson and Kristersson is still statistically secure - but is shrinking compared to January. Confidence in Kristersson increases somewhat and he is now statistically assured ahead of Åkesson.  Ebba Busch increases the most The largest increase is accounted for by Ebba Busch. Her confidence rises statistically by 4 percentage points, from 24 to 28 percent, which means that she is now only one percentage point behind Åkesson. 
 
In the bottom segment, a slight rise can be seen for Elisabeth Thand Ringqvist (C) and Simona Mohamsson (L), who both increase by 2 percentage points. Mistrust is changing In the same survey, mistrust towards Ulf Kristersson drops significantly by 6 percentage points, from 46 to 40 percent. Distrust of Jimmie Åkesson increases by 5 percentage points, from 54 to 59 percent. 

For Elisabeth Thand Ringqvist, mistrust increases by 5 percentage points, from 35 to 40 percent, even though trust is rising at the same time. 

Novus also points to the fact that Ebba Busch received a lot of international attention, including in Davos and in connection with a Gripen campaign in Canada. At the same time, the Christian Democrats lost in Novus' latest voter barometer and ended up under the Riksdag barrier.

## Helena's cat had an emergency caesarean section: "15-20 thousand more expensive"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-25 (today)

She has long experience in dog and cat breeding, but stopped after an emergency a year ago. One of her pregnant cats was unable to wean out the kittens and required a caesarean section. At the clinic, both blood tests, ultrasound and X-rays were required before the operation could be carried out, which led to high additional costs. - I felt that they added thing after thing after thing simply so that the final sum would be higher. Why should you do both an X-ray and an ultrasound, there is no reason. How much more expensive was it? - 15-20 thousand more expensive. More want national guidelines According to the Novus survey, which was carried out on behalf of the insurance company Agria, nine out of ten dog and cat owners want open price lists for veterinary care. Agria is also calling for national guidelines for what should be included in various treatments to avoid unnecessary steps and expensive overtreatment. - My feeling from beginning to end is that this was only about money, says Helena Vikström Roslin
Denies overtreatment Evidensia, where Helena went, says they follow established veterinary guidelines and would never carry out unnecessary treatments to drive up prices. But that prices can still vary. - We have open price lists for everything that can be predicted, but you can never know what is needed until you have had the opportunity to examine the animal and know what is wrong, says chief veterinarian Marlene Areskog. The Swedish Competition Authority investigates transparency The Swedish Competition Authority works on behalf of the government to produce proposals that will strengthen the consumer power of pet owners. A report is expected at the end of next week. Helena Vikström Roslin hopes for change. - It shouldn't have to happen like this. Such costs should not be incurred and there is no need, says Helena Vikström Roslin.

## Details: Trump is considering eliminating the supreme leader's son
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-24 (today)

Student protests at several universities in Iran have continued this week, after demonstrations began at the weekend. Clashes with the Basij militia, a volunteer force within the terrorist-branded Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), have been reported. At the same time, the United States continues to build up military strength in the region. On Thursday, the US military reportedly began moving 12 F-22 fighter jets from an air base in Great Britain to the Middle East, according to Israeli media reports based on flight tracking data. US President Donald Trump is said to be considering military options if negotiations with Iran, which are planned this week, fail. It could be "limited" military strikes to pressure Iran into an agreement, according to information provided to Axios.  - No one knows what the president chooses, says a high-ranking official in the White House to the newspaper. Eliminate the supreme leader's son According to the information, several options are on the table, including a targeted attack on the supreme leader's son, Mojtaba Khamenei - and also his father. - They have something for every scenario. One scenario takes out the ayatollahs and his son and the mullahs, the official told the newspaper. 55-year-old Mojtaba Khamenei has been singled out as a potential replacement for the supreme leader. Another source told Axios that a plan to kill Khamenei and his son was already presented to Trump several weeks ago. "The media can continue to speculate on the president's thinking all they want, but only President Trump knows what he may or may not do," White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said earlier in a statement. A source familiar with the talks told Axios that both Omani and Qatari mediators have told Iran and the United States in recent days that any deal must allow both sides to claim victory and, if possible, also be something the Gulf states and Israel can live with. The US has the largest air force in the Middle East since the 2003 Iraq War.

## Juholt rages over the deportations of young people: "It's only about skin color"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-24 (today)

Afnan Agha came to Sweden as a ten-year-old and has since built up his life in Köping. She is chairman of SSU in western Mälardalen and works in care. But now she risks being deported to Iraq – a country she has no connection to. "It's just about skin color" Håkan Juholt is strongly critical of the current policy and believes that it hits young people who are established and contribute to society. - This is not about integration or refugee policy, it's just about skin color. I didn't think I would get to experience that in Sweden, he says in Efter fem. He also points out that Sweden is facing major demographic challenges and that people like Afnan are needed in the country. - It's like saying: gold is a good asset, but we only use gold that is mined in Sweden. It's stupid and inhumane. When racism and incompetence go hand in hand, Sweden runs into the ditch. We need more people like Afnan, not fewer. The change in the law behind the deportation wave The background to Afnan's situation is a change in the law which means that the possibility of a residence permit due to particularly painful circumstances was abolished. The decision was pushed through by the Tidö parties and the Social Democrats. - It is a completely wrong and unfair assessment of such cases, says Afnan Agha. Several high-profile cases have led to political debate and now the opposition, including the Social Democrats, has supported a proposal for a temporary moratorium to freeze deportations while the legal situation is investigated. The proposal will be presented to the Social Security Committee on Thursday, but needs the support of one more party to pass. Afnan Agha now hopes for a change and describes waiting for a new decision from the Swedish Migration Agency as very stressful. - I try to think about it as little as possible, even though it is my destiny.

## Details: Little girl brutally raped in asylum accommodation
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-24 (today)

The police cordoned off the Migration Agency's return center in Märsta, north of Stockholm, earlier in February. It was stated that it was a serious crime, but since then has not wanted to comment anything further. - Unfortunately, our assessment is that we cannot go into what crime we suspect. Due to the confidentiality of the preliminary investigation, it is also not possible to explain in more detail why we cannot go into the classification, says Daniel Wikdahl, press spokesperson at the Stockholm Police. According to information to TV4 Nyheterna, the police were alerted after a little girl came into hospital with injuries. The police started an investigation and suspected that she had been subjected to a serious rape. Information that emerged in the preliminary investigation made the police suspect that the girl was subjected to the sexual crime inside a toilet in the same building as the reception at the asylum accommodation in Märsta, according to sources for TV4 Nyheterna. The site was cordoned off and a technical investigation was carried out. Now, just over two weeks later, still no suspect has been arrested. A prosecutor has been linked to the case and is very secretive. - I will not comment on this case other than that there are no detainees. I will not answer questions in this matter at this time with reference to pre-trial confidentiality and the need to work undisturbed, says Chamber Prosecutor Urszula Grabowska, who leads the investigation. "The family feels very bad" The court documents confirm that the classification is aggravated rape against children. The girl's parents have received legal counsel. - The family feels very bad, says the plaintiff's assistant Melissa Toutounge Aksöz to SVT. The Swedish Migration Agency states that security measures have been taken and, among other things, extra guards have been called in. - After the police intervention at the reception and return center in Märsta, we increased the presence of both our own staff and guards on site at the accommodation. This is for the purpose of creating security for the people who live with us. Going forward, the safety and security of our accommodation is paramount

## Camilla was sick at home - lost 9,000 kroner
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-24 (today)

Two bouts of illness in one month resulted in a blow of SEK 9,000 in lost income. Camilla Wanhatalo, 47, works as a medical secretary at Malmö University Hospital and is one of those who cannot afford to be sick at home.  - It doesn't feel good at all. If you're sick, you're sick, and then you want to unwind and take it easy, but that's not possible, we still have to work. It's about the money. Now the trade union Vision wants to abolish the retirement allowance, an issue that, for example, the trade union Handels has pushed for many years.  Every other member works when ill Vision conducted a member survey where almost every other member works when ill, a third of them because it is too expensive to stay at home. - We see a high level of sickness absence and that people cannot stay at home. It is about quite a lot of money every month if you are sick for one or two days. It is approximately SEK 1,100 if you earn around SEK 30,000, as many of our members do. It can be the difference between being able to buy winter clothes for the children or being able to pay the bills at the end of the month, says Veronica Magnusson, union chairman for Vision. Voted down repealed retirement allowance The retirement allowance has also been discussed in the Riksdag. At the latest in November, the Social Democrats' proposal was voted on in the social insurance committee to scrap the retirement allowance. Johan Britz (L), labor market minister, is one of those who stand behind the retirement allowance. - I think we must constantly continue to discuss the work environment and improve it, not least within the contact profession. But abolishing the retirement allowance would be bad for Sweden, our economy and it would be unfair to those who pull a big load every day, says Johan Britz (L). Camilla Wanhatalo herself wants the retirement allowance to go away. - Then people would have stayed at home when you were sick. They had not come here and infected others. I don't think anyone here would have benefited from being at home, she says.

## The Olympic coup in Cortina – fooled everyone
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-24 (today)

Federico Corsetti and Giancarlo Folonari, both from Milan, decided to follow in their uncle's footsteps and create their own Olympic adventure. By printing clothes and flags with Mandostan's symbols, they managed to get into several parties and events during the Winter Olympics in Milan and Cortina. The idea was born from an old family story. Already in 2006, Corsetti's uncle had managed to trick his way into the Olympics in Turin by pretending to be an athlete from a fictitious country.  - As soon as we heard that the Olympics would take place in Milan and Cortina, we drove there and did the same thing. It was incredible, says Federico Corsetti. Fooled both Boris Becker and Jürgen Klopp The duo says that at first it was difficult to convince people that they were real athletes, but that it got easier each time. They spoke in a made-up language and presented Mandostan as an old Soviet country under the Pamir Mountains in Central Asia. - We had to speak broken English and say: Hi, I'm from Mandostan, says Giancarlo Folonari. With the help of their roles, they managed to trick their way into events where they met famous profiles such as Boris Becker and Jürgen Klopp.  - It was a fantastic feeling. Because we pretended to be athletes, it was like talking to each other as colleagues, says Folonari. Believed to be a terrorist group One of the most memorable moments was when they convinced a Canadian skier that Mandostan really existed - after two hours of talking. However, the adventure almost came to an abrupt end when they put Mandostan's flag on a thirty meter high pole during the Olympics. - It was not a good idea. The fear of terrorist attacks is very high during the Olympics, so they thought it was a terrorist group. But it was just us, says Corsetti.

## The payment giant Klarna cooperates with at least eleven scam shops
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-24 (today)

Yesterday, Kalla revealed the facts that Dutch fraudsters used AI-generated videos with Swedish celebrities to sell miracle pills - capsules that claim to cure cancer and epilepsy, among other things. In the checkout, Klarna was listed as a payment intermediary. Now the tangle is growing.  Klarna has not only worked together with the Dutch fraudsters. The Swedish financial company is a payment intermediary for at least eleven online shops that market products with illegal health promises - this can now be revealed by Kalla fakta.  The online shops violate the Medicines Act and the Food Act - that is what the Swedish Medicines Agency and the Swedish Food Agency assess when Kalla fakta asks questions about the marketing of the products.  Banned - but continues to sell One of the sites is Natural hemp life. The webshop sells CBD oil with claims that the product protects against severe diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Health claims are prohibited. When the Swedish Medicines Agency tried to stop the online shop, the company moved operations to Poland. From there, sales continue – aimed at Swedish consumers. And at checkout: Klarna as a payment intermediary. "Klarna has a huge responsibility" Klarna is registered as a bank and is covered by the Money Laundering Act. This means that the company is obliged to have good customer knowledge - to understand which companies it does business with and what type of business they conduct.
Marie Wallin is a former chamber prosecutor and expert on money laundering. She believes that Klarna's actions may be criminal.  - Klarna has a huge responsibility. They need to understand that they have to be the troublesome gatekeeper against this kind of thing. I think there are conditions for both the Financial Supervisory Authority and the law enforcement authorities to review whether Klarna follows the rules as they should.   Just over a year ago, the Financial Supervisory Authority cracked down on shortcomings in Klarna's customer knowledge. The company received a penalty fee of half a billion kroner. Now new questions are raised. - As a lawyer in the financial market area, I am thinking about whether Klarna has control over all parts of its operations - o

## Reveals his "usual Monday": Red light therapy, PT and skin care
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-24 (today)

In "Girls of Stockholm", four of Sweden's biggest influencers show off their luxurious lives. Season two premieres on February 27, and among those who are followed in the series are Lovisa Worge and Hanna Friberg. In Nyhetsmorgon, Lovisa Worge tells us that she enjoys a more routine life, even if it's not as fun to show off. - Our life is very... You have to show the luxurious and it has to be... Or should, many do. But I like this squirrel wheel and going to the office, she says. "There is no ordinary day in my life" Lovisa Worge runs, in addition to her influencer company, two more companies - including one together with her best friend Bianca Ingrosso. When she's not out and about, a typical Tuesday usually involves office work between nine and five. - If I'm at home, it's a very normal everyday life, says Lovisa Worge. She starts the day with a session with her personal trainer. The same PT also trains Hanna Friberg - but an hour before. - I get up very early in the morning. I have a little more... there is no ordinary day in my life, everything looks so different to me, says Hanna Friberg. Her day usually starts with breakfast, red light therapy, News Morning and a skincare routine – and ends with a dinner event. Spreading the content However, this is not all that viewers will see in the new season, with much of the everyday content being saved for their own channels instead. The profiles have separated what appears in the series and what is published in their other platforms. - It gets very boring if you sit in a podcast and tell exactly everything that has happened and then four months later it comes on TV. Then there is no news value, says Lovisa Worge. The most common misconception about influencers, she says, is that they are detached from the world and think that life is like on Instagram. - We have a very good self-distance to it. It's a job and we run a company, says Lovisa Worge.

**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-24 (today)

It was in the early 2000s that Micael Ullerteg, a resident of Algutsrum on Öland, attended a private party at the Vasa Museum. When he sat under the bow of the ship, his eyes were fixed - and the fascination. - I was so incredibly impressed by the ship when I sat there, he says. Shortly after the visit, he bought an extensive kit of the Vasaskeppet, unaware that the model was intended for professionals. The work began at home in the garage and quickly became more time-consuming than expected. The guild alone took ten years to complete. - There are no parts that are simply glued together. Each plank must be soaked, bent over a light and shaped. It's a huge job, he says. "The cowls are wine corks" When the scythe was finished, he temporarily lost the desire to go on the rig. - There are an awful lot of tampers and threads. So I put it aside for a while, says Micael. Instead, Ullerteg began to manufacture figures and details. It turned out to be everything from sailors and blacksmiths to cows and houses along a self-built quay. - The old men are made of toothpicks and matches. The boxes are wine corks. I have used the foil from a kava bottle for buckets. You have to come up with solutions all the time, he says. In the end, there were so many figures that they couldn't fit on the ship itself. - My wife said it didn't work. Then I built a wharf too. And then there were even more details, says Micael. Fatal accident during Idol night One of the few setbacks occurred when he had the TV on in the background while building. - There was a guy in Idol who sang so terribly fake. I stood up, walked towards the TV and backed right into the ship. The stern went into the floor and became splinters. I had to rebuild everything, he says. Despite extensive work, breaks and Idol accidents, he has never come close to finishing the project. - No, I have never given up. I have only built when I felt like it, instead of sitting in front of the TV. It has always been fun, he says. "A special feeling" The last two years were spent on the rig - the part he retired

## Price slip after the stop: "Will probably be a juicy bill"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-24 (today)

On Thursday, electricity prices soared in large parts of Sweden. In the south of Sweden, electricity prices rose sharply, with over five kroner per kilowatt hour. The stoppage in one of Sweden's six nuclear power reactors thus comes at a time of already high electricity prices, even if the worst price spikes have subsided now that the cold is releasing its grip on the country. The reactor at Oskarshamn is taken out of operation after an unexpected failure.  - The price will be a little higher, especially in the southern electricity areas. Should it get a bit cold during March, we will continue to be connected to the German electricity prices. We've been doing that for a while now, but it's becoming even more frequent and clearer. We don't get as much cheap electricity from northern Sweden, says Johan Sigvardsson, electricity price analyst at Bixia. Mild weather and wind For many, February's electricity bill will be the biggest for a long time. Meteorologist Ulrika Elvgren gives a forecast for this week's electricity prices and explains how the weather affects it. - The weather has a greater effect than ever. At my house, the electric cartridge has been humming throughout January and half of February, so it will probably be a juicy bill, she says in Nyhetsmorgon. Both temperature and wind affect the price. The temperature controls the consumption and the wind how much wind power you can get out. - What looks favorable in the coming week is that it will be both windier and milder, which will benefit electricity prices by keeping them down a bit, says Ulrika Elvgren. More than half from water Right now the power distribution looks like we get a little more than half of our electricity from hydropower, almost 27 percent from nuclear power and about ten percent from wind power. Wind power will increase now that it will blow more and nuclear power will decrease with the shutdown of the reactor in Oskarshamn. In addition, Formark 3 will enter an audit in March. - You can probably expect that it is above all in southern Sweden that it is more price sensitive. You notice that even during the weekend, although it is quite cheap, it is a bit higher in the south, because of the connection to the continent.

## The expert: This is what you do if you are cheated in online shopping
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-24 (today)

Cold facts revealed this week that the payment service Klarna cooperated with a company that sold fake pills that were claimed to be able to cure cancer and epilepsy.  Despite complaints and several notifications about misleading marketing, Klarna did not end the cooperation with the Dutch company until after Kalla fakta's review.  Right to get money back If a product does not live up to what was promised, you should first of all contact the company you bought from to get a working product or cancel the purchase and get the money back, says Maria Wiezell, consumer advisor at Sweden's Consumers.  - You have the right to that according to the Consumer Purchase Act, she says. If you paid with a credit card or with a service such as Klarna, according to the Consumer Credit Act, you have the right to turn to the credit company if the company does not solve the problem, says Wiezell. - Then the creditor must instead do what the company is obliged to do and ensure that you get the money back.  Important to have proof In order to get the money back, it is important to read about what the product promises. - Unfortunately, the marketing does not always correspond to the reservations that are made in the contract terms themselves. The third step is to turn to the General Complaints Board. Then it is important to have evidence in the form of, for example, screenshots of what the company promised, says Wiezell.  But with some products it is difficult to show that they did not have the promised effect, she adds. - Therefore, in some cases it has been easier to refer to the right of withdrawal.

## Then the African blood rain can sweep in over Sweden
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-24 (today)

When warm air is expected to flow in over parts of Europe later this week, it will bring with it sand particles from the Sahara, which Göteborgs-Posten first reported on. - It is dust that has swirled up in the atmosphere and then been transported. Now it has followed these deep low pressures to the north, and when it then rains, the sand can fall from the atmosphere with the rain, says TV4 Nyheternas meteorologist Ulrika Elvgren. The phenomenon when the blown sand combines with rain and falls to the ground is called blood rain. - You can see some reddish drops on, for example, the bonnet of the car. It is most visible if it is raining on top of snow, says Ulrika Elvgren. Moving in during Thursday The rain area is expected to move in over the west coast and a little inland during Thursday afternoon - but it is not entirely certain that the rain of blood will be felt.  - It can rain a little bit over Denmark, so that there are not so many sand particles left when it comes over Sweden, says Maria Svedestig, meteorologist at SMHI. Despite the dramatic name, blood rain is therefore harmless - and not entirely unusual either. It happens once a year and is most common on the west coast.

## Sabotaged water works: "Not an attempt to harm Sweden"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-24 (today)

On the way to the building where the power had gone, the police found plugs thrown in the snow. Inside the building, the light was red and the alarm box displayed an error code. The emergency button had been pressed and the power to the waterworks that supplies all of Västerås with water had gone out.  Walked in - wasn't locked In the police investigation, it appears that the staff at the waterworks were extremely worried about what happened and that a single person had managed to accomplish the whole thing. They couldn't understand how someone managed to cut off the power and the backup generator at the same time.  "They see no other way out than that it is a deliberate action to sabotage a socially important activity and that you know exactly what you are doing and what needed to be done to get the desired effect," the police write in a memo. The surveillance images show how the man pulled a little on a gate and yanked on a door to get into the power station. In the investigation, it appears that neither the gate nor the door appeared to be locked, nor did the man use any tools.  Mälarenergi, which operates the facility, has previously stated that they will review safety.  Wore a Russian cap and talked about submarines The incident happened on the night of January 30 and the following morning the staff managed to restore everything and get the facility up and running again. That same night, the police were also able to arrest the perpetrator near the waterworks. Then he wore a cap with the Russian coat of arms. He told the police directly that it was he who had been inside the power station.  "When the patrol drives the man into the station, he states that he has learned several different languages but that
he regrets not learning Russian. He also states that he would like to go to Russia and study martial arts," the police write in their report.  The officers felt that the man was psychotic and was talking incoherently. On several occasions he talked about there being Russian submarines hiding in the forest. They said he felt disconnected from reality throughout the intervention. The 30-year-old ha

## The doctor: This is how you avoid common eye problems
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-24 (today)

Screen eyes is often called digital eye fatigue and means tired, dry and irritated eyes caused by screen work. Symptoms can be headache, blurred vision and neck pain. It occurs, among other things, because we blink less often. - It is important to have the screen at the right height. If you have the screen a little too high, you are forced to stare more and blink too little. You are so interested in focusing on what you are doing that you blink less, says Bo Andersén. Ergonomics and breaks Sitting correctly and ergonomically is therefore part of the solution. - When you are interested, you like to curl up. You should sit ergonomically, with your shoulders back. Like being out riding. Sway in the back and the screen at the right distance, says Bo Andersén in Nyhetsmorgon. Another important point is to take breaks. There is something called the 20-20-20 rule and it means that every 20 minutes you rest your eyes for 20 seconds on something that is 20 feet (about 6 meters) away. The eyes change with age. For problems with dry, itchy eyes, Andersén recommends starting with terminal glasses in time. So-called presbyopia, or presbyopia, usually occurs at the age of 45 and also affects the eyes. - Then maybe an eye examination is even needed. Some struggle up to 55, but then they probably have a bit more headaches and discomfort, says Bo Andersén. With age, the production of lubricant in the glands in the eyes also decreases. Then you may need eye drops. Then you should examine yourself. Another everyday problem is small things that move around in the eye or in the field of vision, so-called vitreous detachment. It is a harmless age-related change in which the eye's jelly detaches from the retina. - It is extremely common. It's a little scary and you get a little worried, but I usually compare it to the skin wrinkling. You can have small figures in the field of vision and the typical thing is that it follows the movements, says Andersén. It is usually nothing serious, but you should have it examined if it comes on suddenly, or if there are large swarms of dots or lines.

## Left the gala - after Tourette's exclamation: "Devastated"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-24 (1 day old)

John Davidson could be heard shouting the 'n-word' as actors Delroy Lindo and Michael B Jordan presented an award at Sunday's British Film Awards.  Both actors said afterwards that they took the incident very seriously and the BBC pulled the show from its streaming service because of the incident. "We would like to thank Michael and Delroy for their dignified and professional conduct," the British Film Academy wrote in a statement.  Left gala Coprolalia, involuntary outbursts of foul language or sexual innuendo, is a symptom that can affect those with Tourette's.  John Davidson was there because the film "I swear", which is based on his life story, was nominated and won an award at the gala. He says he chose to leave the salon during the awards ceremony because he realized he was making other people feel uncomfortable. "I have dedicated my life to supporting and highlighting people with Tourette's and to trying to work for compassion, kindness and understanding from others and I intend to continue to do so," Davidson said in a statement.
