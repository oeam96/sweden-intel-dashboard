## The electricity price is soaring - that's when it's at its highest
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-19 (today)

In electricity area 4 in southern Sweden, the price peak is expected to reach SEK 5.2 per kilowatt hour. The daily average lands at around SEK 1.8 per kilowatt hour, according to compilations from Vattenfall. Even in electricity areas 2 and 3, the levels are high and at approximately the same levels, while electricity area 1 in northern Sweden receives somewhat lower prices. There, the highest level is estimated to be SEK 4.4 per kilowatt hour and the average for the day around SEK 1.7 per kilowatt hour. - We have had weak winds recently, so the wind power cannot produce as much energy. At the same time, the large water reservoirs have not been filled at the pace needed, says TV4's meteorologist Ulrika Elvgren.  At the same time, the high electricity prices look set to remain high in the future, partly because there is little water in the large reservoirs and bottlenecks in the electricity grid.

## Imprisoned children are proposed to be locked up for a maximum of 11 hours
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-19 (today)

At the beginning of July, the criminal age for serious crimes will be lowered to 13 years and at the same time the new youth prisons will also be in operation.  A long series of special rules adapted to children will be introduced, among other things, provisions will be introduced on "the best interests of the child".  Detained children must also have the right to be heard and the child's views must be taken into account. This does not mean that the incarcerated children themselves can decide on the enforcement, but their best interests and the opinions they express must be taken into account.  "It's important that we invest in education" Another thing is that young people and adults should be kept apart. It is an important measure to prevent young people from being schooled into more serious crime.  Just like adults, young people will be covered by the Prison Act's employment obligation, but it will mainly consist of education.  - It is important that we invest in education. It's about which children we want to get out after serving their sentence, says Martin Melin, justice policy spokesperson for the Liberals.  Each inmate must have an individual plan with a focus on education and relapse prevention treatment. The plan must be drawn up by the Correctional Service in close cooperation with social services and the guardian. More right to contact with family In many parts, the regulations that apply to adult inmates will also apply to incarcerated children. However, a number of other adaptations to the legislation are proposed, to ensure that enforcement is adapted to children's special needs and rights. A rule is introduced in the Prison Act that children's right to maintain contact with their family must be taken into account in particular in matters of visits and other contacts. The purpose is, among other things, to reduce the risk of adverse effects of the deprivation of liberty. In 2025, there were 259 people aged 15-18 who were sentenced to closed youth care at the State Board of Institutions SIS. If current laws had been in force, they would have been sentenced to youth prison instead, according to the government office's assessments. In the future, there will be more people because

## Big test: Here is the worst dog food
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-19 (today)

Since the dog is recommended to eat the same thing every day, it is important that the feed should give the dog everything it needs in terms of nutrition and energy. Råd and Rön have tested 21 types of complete food for adult dogs and the amount of protein, carbohydrates, minerals and fatty acids has been checked, among other things. Worst in test Three products end up at the bottom because of too low a nutritional content. Magnusson adult and Doggy original both had too little methionine. The latter brand and Coop Xtra dog food contain too little vitamin A. - Coop Xtra and Doggy have cereal as the first ingredient. Those that have it as the first ingredient end up at the bottom of our table, that they have a slightly lower nutritional content, says Anna Edberg, responsible for food tests at Råd & Rön.  However, at the bottom of the list is Petgood dog adult insect based, which is one of two products containing insects. Both fare well nutritionally, but Petgood stands out negatively. Namely, the feed contains high levels of glycoalkaloids, which can form in poorly handled potatoes and which can be toxic to the dog.  - This one contains high levels of these poisons, says Anna Edberg in the news morning.  Petgood writes to TV4 Nyhetsmorgon that measures have been taken to ensure low levels of glycoalkaloids and that no dogs have been found to be ill so far.   Big differences in price The price differences are big and the kilo price for the tested products varies between SEK 18 and 225. The price difference partly depends on which ingredients the feed contains, where meat and animal products are often more expensive. While different cereals are cheaper.  See which dog food tops the list in the clip below.

## New study: Ministry of Health understated death toll in Gaza
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-19 (today)

The study is based on a survey of 2,000 families in Gaza, selected to represent the population. The researchers tallied both direct and indirect deaths between the terrorist attack on Israel on October 7, 2023 and January 5, 2025. In total, 42,200 women, children and the elderly died in attacks – 56 percent of the direct deaths. The study also shows that the Ministry of Health's reporting on the proportion of women, children and the elderly among the dead has been correct. Fewer indirect deaths The researchers estimate that 3-4 percent of Gaza's population has been killed in the conflict. A further 8,000 people are believed to have died indirectly from, for example, diseases or malnutrition, according to the study.  Researcher Michael Spagat has been working on calculating deaths in conflicts for twenty years.  He questions an earlier study, also published in the Lancet, which showed that the indirect deaths were far more than the direct ones – probably around four times as many.  - In Gaza, there were initially resources in the form of trained doctors and a functioning health system. In addition, the area is small, so once help arrives it can be quickly distributed, says Spagat. May never get answers Data on death tolls have been disputed. An Israeli security source recently said the Gaza health ministry's figures are "largely correct". The Department of Health now states that over 71,660 people have been killed directly by Israeli attacks, including more than 570 after the October 2025 ceasefire. Other studies have reached similar conclusions, but some have estimated even more indirect deaths and a greatly reduced life expectancy. The researchers behind the Lancet study believe that it will take a long time before there is a complete picture of the death toll.

- It is not a given that there will be a large research project to reconstruct what actually happened. It will take a long time before we get a full account of all the dead in Gaza, if we ever get it, says Michael Spagat.

## The US may attack Iran – this weekend
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-19 (today)

According to several US media, the US military has increased its presence in the region in recent weeks. Among other things, several military ships and warplanes have been sent to the area and an aircraft carrier is already near Iran. An attack was supposed to take place this weekend, but Donald Trump has not yet decided on an attack, according to CNN. - There are many arguments to put forward for an attack, says White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. At the same time, she emphasizes that diplomacy is still the president's first option. - I will not set any deadlines for the president. Diplomacy is always his first option, but military action remains on the table. Agree on guiding principles On Wednesday, senior security advisers gathered in the White House to discuss the situation, according to a source with access to information. Even then, Trump is said to have been updated with what was said in the indirect talks that were recently held with Iran in Geneva. The indirect talks between the US and Iran continued for several hours. According to Iran's chief negotiator, the parties agreed on some guiding principles, but US officials say many details remain before any settlement can be reached. At the same time, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt states that Iran is expected to present a more detailed proposal within the coming weeks. At the same time, it is unclear whether the US is patient enough to wait for the proposal before a possible military decision is made. Israel may participate According to Israeli sources to Axios, Israel may also participate in a possible attack on Iran. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is expected to travel to Israel on February 28 to inform Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the negotiations and the current situation. Several Arab states have reportedly tried to dissuade the United States from a military intervention out of fear that the entire region will be further destabilized. At the same time, new satellite images show that Iran is strengthening protection around several important nuclear facilities, according to the US

## Pharmacies are booming again in rural areas - there is a lack of pharmacists
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-19 (today)

The background to the closure in Hova is above all the lack of pharmacists, i.e. drug managers, but also a failing customer base. According to the Dental Care and Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency, four of the 14 pharmacies that closed last year were the only ones in the town. At the same time, the number of pharmacies in urban areas has increased. Unequal access to medicines Sweden's Pharmacists believe that rural areas do not get equal access to medicines and want to make the profession more attractive.   - The shortage of pharmacists in pharmacies has long been challenging. It is not considered attractive to work in a pharmacy because of the conditions and the working environment. You and I, we need our medicines and if there aren't pharmacists with pharmaceutical expertise out there, we won't get them and that's worrying, says Annika Hage Nederström, head of negotiations at Sveriges Farmaceuter. The government wants to strengthen the pharmacy market In a written statement to TV4 Nyheterna, Social Affairs Minister Jakob Forssmed agrees that the shortage of pharmacists is a challenge, especially in sparsely populated areas. He emphasizes that the government is working with several tools to strengthen the pharmacy market and raise the status of the profession.

In Hova, many are worried about the development.   - There are many important things that have disappeared. For example, we had three banks when I moved here. Now there is nothing. And real mail doesn't exist either, says Usko Punnönen, Hovabo.   - And now no pharmacy.   - No, exactly yes. That too. That it disappeared. I miss it a lot actually, he says.

**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-19 (today)

There are photos of Mandelson in his underwear with an unknown woman, as well as mysterious money transactions - and information that Mandelson shared secret information with Epstein during his time as a minister. Now Keir Starmer's judgment is deeply questioned.

Säpo: Can't go into details The matter has been handled as a security case by Säpo, but with reference to the secrecy in the USA, they have not wanted to comment further on the criminal suspicions.  - Since the Security Police is assisting another country in their criminal investigation, we cannot go into any details, said Säpo's press spokesperson Jonathan Svensson to TV4 Nyheterna on Tuesday.  The Russian man has been detained since his arrest. Säpo also carried out the house search and several items were seized, including mobile phones.

## Right-wing activist beaten to death - used as propaganda
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-18 (today)

Right-wing activist Quentin Deranque, 23, was beaten to death by left-wing extremists in connection with a far-right demonstration in the French city of Lyon on Thursday. The incident has triggered a political crisis in the country, and gained great importance within the far-right movement. Video clips show six masked people attacking three people lying on the ground. Two manage to escape, but Quentin Deranque stayed behind and was badly beaten. He later died in hospital as a result of his injuries. The autopsy showed fatal injuries to his skull and brain. Support from far-right groups After the death, nationalist and far-right groups around Europe, including Sweden, Denmark and Germany, portrayed him as a martyr and paid tribute to him. They use the event for propaganda purposes, to mobilize support and to recruit new members, says Christer Mattsson, researcher at the University of Gothenburg. - It is a matter of course for these groups to stand up for people who belong to their own environment and who in this case have lost their lives, says Christer Mattsson. - National borders are not really that interesting to them, but what is important is whiteness. That white people stick together racially and culturally, he continues. Want to avenge the murder On social media there are also discussions about revenge for the 23-year-old's death and calls to find the culprits.  - Violence is seen as a means of seizing power, but it also has the ideological component that it separates the strong from the weak. Through violence also comes sacrifice. In Sweden, among others, White Boys Sweden and Aktivklubb Sweden have honored Deranque on social media. White Boys Stockholm has also held a demonstration for the victim. "White man, fight back", and "Justice for Quentin" are some of the posts. "Quentin is with us," the group writes in a post. Want to avenge the murder Martyrdom Mattsson explains that martyrdom is deeply rooted in the far-right movement. –

## Want to see snowball fights at recess - for the sake of the children's health
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-18 (today)

Snowball fights during school breaks have long been debated - now the Swedish Sports Teachers Association wants that and wrestling to be allowed, which SVT was the first to report. The association believes that it is important for children's motor skills and coordination, while at the same time it prevents bullying.  - You can sprain a foot, but a foot heals. Missed training in courage, reciprocity and trust can probably leave bigger scars, says Jennie Nobelius, president of the Swedish Sports Teachers' Association.  Support from research In Sweden, it is the municipalities and schools that decide what is permitted and the Swedish National Agency for Education has no general recommendation. Snowball fights are prohibited at Skanskvarnsskolan in Stockholm.  - The children can play in other ways. There is a difference between a home environment and a school environment, we have responsibility for the children's safety and security, says the school's principal Ingrid Gustavsson. Rune Storli, docent at Queen Maud's University in Trondheim, has researched risky play and believes that it is an important part of children's exploration.  - It is a good arena for developing social skills and learning about boundaries. It's like the Astrid Lindgren quote: "he who is very strong must also be very kind". He refers to studies that show that children who are allowed to play risky develop social skills more easily.  - When children do not meet physically in wild play, they lose an important dimension of how to learn to be social. Even animals play in this way. "Arguments happen all the time" The Swedish Sports Teachers' Association believes that excessive protection can inhibit children's development.  - We are creating a bubble wrap society where safety replaces development in the children, says Jennie Nobelius.  Ingrid Gustavsson does not share the image that children are protected too much and questions how snowball fights should counter bullying.  - I find it difficult to see how wrestling or snowball fights could achieve what we want to achieve within the school. Jennie Nobelius sees conflicts as part of learning, if it takes place under the supervision of adults.  - Ordinary quarrels happen all the time and conflict management is a must

## The hair started to burn - Marie about the viral accident in the candle shop
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-18 (today)

It was last Friday, the unlucky day the 13th, that it happened. Marie Söderberg bent over to pick among candles when her large tuft of hair ended up in a heat lamp and caught fire. Neither she nor the customer in the store noticed anything. It was only when a colleague saw the flames and shouted her name that the situation became serious.  "I didn't notice it was on fire" The colleague's shout made her react.
 
- I thought: Where the hell is that coming from? And then I looked in the mirror – yes! Then it was just a matter of turning it off quickly, she says. Even though it burned badly, Marie did not suffer any damage to her skin. However, she had to say goodbye to part of her hair, and to the big tassel she used to have. - It might say something about how much hair I actually have, although you can't see it now. It has become less. I lost some, says Söderberg. Caught on film The incident was caught on the store's surveillance camera and the clip has spread quickly on social media. When Marie and her colleagues saw the film afterwards, they were shocked by how powerful the flames were, but today they can laugh about it. The fact that it was also Friday the 13th is not something she missed.

 - If you are shocked, you can think about whether it had anything to do with the case or not, she says with a laugh. Today, she is most grateful that it all, thank God, ended well. Now Marie would like to remind others to be careful with candles.

## The hotel chain exposed to a cyber attack – information has been leaked
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-18 (today)

The hotel chain BWH Hotels has 191 hotels in the Nordic region in more than 100 destinations. Now the Best Western chain has been exposed to a cyber attack in which customers' personal data was leaked.  Those affected are customers in Sweden, Denmark and Norway. In recent days, the attackers have come across booking information, email addresses and phone numbers. The chain was alerted to the incident via customer service and the hotel, which raised the alarm. Marketing manager Sara Hallsund cannot answer the exact date of when the attack took place. - We are of course investigating what has happened and what kind of messages are going out. Unfortunately, it is really a big social problem today and now we have also been affected by this, she says. Hallsund cannot answer what extent it is.  - I have no information about it at the moment.  Customers with reservations have received messages on Whatsapp, text messages and emails with a link in recent days. Wants a debit card TV4 Nyheterna has taken note of a message sent via Whatsapp from a confirmed company account. It says the first and last name, as well as the check-in date for the current booking. Then it says that "action is required" and that the booking is not "fully completed". The customer is then prompted to click on a link.

Via the link, the attackers want the customer to confirm their payment card number. The payment card information has not been leaked, according to Sara Hallsund. - So that's what you're trying to fish for, she says.  Exactly what type of attack it is is not yet clear. - We have brought in a data security partner who helps us see what is happening, says Hallsund. "Be vigilant" On Best Western's Swedish website, there is a message at the top of the site. It says: "Your security is important. Be alert for unexpected messages asking for information or payment. Contact the hotel if anything feels suspicious." Why don't you specify that such messages abound on Whatsapp, for example? - We think that you need to be vigilant as an individual in general right now in the community

## The Minister of Foreign Affairs does not rule out nuclear weapons in Sweden
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-18 (today)

On Wednesday, the Sweden Democrats opened up to the possibility that nuclear weapons may have to be placed in Sweden even in gray zone situations - between war and peace. The party's foreign policy spokesperson Aron Emilsson believes that the situation Sweden is in is "beginning to resemble" a gray area, something TT reported. Unlike Norway, Sweden has no legal ban on nuclear weapons - and the position is that nuclear weapons should not be in Sweden in peacetime.  Requires broad discussion Sweden's nuclear deterrent lies primarily with the United States - of which Sweden is a part through NATO membership, emphasizes Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard.  - Then there are important complements in Europe, partly in Great Britain and partly in France. There is a doctrine in Sweden and we have also written in the NATO bill that in peacetime you do not have nuclear weapons on Swedish soil. Malmer Stenergard refers to Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson's statement that Sweden is not at war but not at peace either. At the same time, the nuclear weapons discussion should not be a matter of interpretations, she believes. - If this is to be changed, then there must be a serious discussion within the alliance, between allies in NATO and of course there must also be broad support in the Riksdag. It's not something you change lightly, says Malmer Stenergard and adds that a discussion should also be held with the Nordic countries. Serious situation She does not rule out that the issue may need to be reviewed, but emphasizes that it requires both national and Nordic anchoring.  - Actually, I don't think you should rule anything out when we have such a serious security policy situation in Europe and a war in our immediate area. There is a lot that we didn't think would happen that has happened in a fairly short time, says Malmer Stenergard.

## How much patience does Trump have?
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-18 (today)

By all accounts, the pressure on Ukraine is now increasing, even though US envoy Steve Witkoff expresses himself positively about the state of negotiations. The American president is fickle, but lately his statements have mostly been about Ukraine needing to be more willing to negotiate and compromise.  While there have been exceptions over the past year, Trump has rarely talked about Russian concessions.  The common thread has nevertheless been that it is President Zelensky who should understand his and his country's best interests and end the war even if it means enormous concessions.

As two days of talks ended in Geneva today, it was clear that both the Russian and Ukrainian delegations were of the same opinion: that the deliberations had been difficult.  Both sides said the parties will meet again, but no dates were announced. The outside world had not expected a breakthrough, but perhaps some details have become clearer to those involved beyond the media noise surrounding the meetings. The war is far away for the Americans In a week, Ukraine commemorates the fallen on the anniversary of four years of war. No other war in Europe since the Second World War has shaken the continent like Russia's large-scale invasion in 2022. The fate of Ukraine is constantly on the agenda when Europe's politicians meet and has had far-reaching consequences for security policy, defense budgets and people's view of the future on our continent.  At the same time, war is now everyday life for Ukrainians, Europeans and perhaps Americans. Why do I write "maybe"? Well, because the war has always been far away for the Americans. "Has his legacy to think about" Therefore, it is not just Trump's pursuit of the peace prize or a general impatience that explains why he wants to quickly end the war - possibly as early as the summer, as it is claimed.  Many Americans do not understand how Ukraine concerns them, and Trump has both his aftermath and the November midterm elections on his mind.  From this perspective, one can see T

## NRJ snubbed on broadcast license: "A shock message"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-18 (today)

On Wednesday, the Swedish Media Agency decided that Aftonbladet will receive a broadcasting license to broadcast national radio. At the same time, the radio station NRJ loses its licence. - This is a shock message that we find difficult to take in. We are both sad and upset. 1.5 million listeners will lose their radio station and our employees risk losing their jobs, says NRJ CEO Richard Mazeret in a press release. NRJ has been broadcast for 33 years in Sweden - and is the only commercial radio station that increased its listenership figures in 2025. - We are the only actor that is growing. At the same time, the license is instead given to a completely unproven actor with no experience in radio, and who also increases the media concentration in Sweden. This makes the Media Authority's decision very difficult to understand, says Richard Mazeret.  The explanation: "There are only three permits" At the same time, Aftonbladet calls this a historic step. - This is one of our biggest investments in many years, and a clear expression of our ambition to reach more people with journalism in everyday life, says Lotta Folcker, publisher at Aftonbladet to Aftonbladet.  NRJ is forced to stop broadcasting on July 31 this year - and the license passes to Aftonbladet the following day. The media authority believes that they are handing over the license so that Aftonbladet can offer something new to the listeners, as they will have a news focus. - There are only three permits, and if Aftonbladet is to broadcast radio, someone else has to leave. Then we came to the conclusion that it is NRJ that must give way because the frequencies must be used efficiently, says Ola Vigström, a lawyer at the Media Authority to Aftonbladet.  The profile: "We carry on as usual" Sofia Wistam, Anis don Demina and Sebastian "Basse" Widman are all big profiles at NRJ. "It feels boring, of course, but now it's up to us to get as many regional permits as possible so we can continue to be heard in large parts of the country," writes Sebastian "Basse" Widman in a text message to TV4 Nyheterna. Widman tells us that it

## Therefore, we close our eyes to the dangers on the ice
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-18 (today)

Over the weekend, at least five people walked through the ice in central Stockholm, despite warnings. And it is a problem all over the country that people go out on the ice without knowledge and safety equipment. What is it that attracts us to take the risk? Per Carlbring, professor of psychology at Stockholm University, believes that it is herd behavior. - I see that others are out and it is precisely this herd behavior that makes you dare to go out. You don't really have a clue yourself, but you think it's proof that it actually works, he says. New perspectives He believes that herd behavior has served humanity. - That is how we have survived. That we have looked at what others are doing. That we don't have to experience everything ourselves to dare to do things. So this particular thing about what others are doing has been very good for us. It seems good to eat watermelon, then I also eat watermelon, says Per Carlbring. Another reason is to see things from a new perspective. - That you can go out and perhaps see your home from a different angle. But think before you go out. It's lovely, but is it worth it? "Getting a shock" You should think about what happens if you fall and what the consequences are. - Would you go for a winter swim on your own? What actually happens in the body? You get a shock and can't really control what happens. You can get a reflex to take a deep breath - and if you do it under water, it will be very bad, warns Per Carlbring. There are few who have actually tried to plur and get back up. - In principle, almost no Swedes have that. And you should actually have that on your track record the same year you consider going out on the ice.

## Fewer people are sentenced for bribery - despite more serious crimes
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-18 (1 day old)

The total value of the bribery offenses was just over SEK 24 million in 2025. That is greater than the combined value for both 2023 and 2024, according to the report. Within the building and construction industry, it was exclusively serious bribery that took place last year, says Parul Sharma. - I think it's time for this industry to actually get to grips with the matter. We have not seen as many serious bribery crimes gathered in one industry as we have in 2025. It is serious and alarming, she says in Nyhetsmorgon. Nepotism common The average bribery offender is a 51-year-old man working in the private sector. The recipient is also within the same age group, but works in the public sector. - This is often where we see our bribery crimes in Sweden take place. If you look at last year's bribery convictions, we see that in 65 percent of the cases, it is about the exercise of authority, says Parul Sharma. Half of all bribery convictions in 2025 were related to crony corruption or nepotism. - We see a fairly high degree of nepotistic relationships in the serious bribery offences. It is old colleagues, sometimes family members, with whom you do business, says Parul Sharma. "Cash is still king" Bribes usually consist of money, vehicles, pleasure trips and restaurant visits. Renovations are also common – it is used as an indirect payment, explains Parul Sharma. - When we at the institute ask what Swedes think is the most common bribe, people usually say: "Not money, well, that's far too shameful." But cash is still king. Money is still the most common bribe. She believes that the number of darkness is large. - The difficult thing in Sweden is that we are not inclined to blow the whistle or report to the police. The dark figure is enormous. We see fewer convictions, but also alarmingly much worse bribery offences.

## KD below the bar – L left at bottom level
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-18 (1 day old)

The Christian Democrats lose to 3.8 percent and end up under the Riksdag barrier. The Liberals remain at 2.1 percent - the same level as on two previous occasions, both when Johan Pehrson was newly elected party leader and just before the election of Simona Mohamsson. The survey also shows that none of the governing parties is winning voters. - The most interesting thing is that none of the governing parties win voters. The opposition's lead is increasing, says Torbjörn Sjöström, CEO of Novus. Tough situation for the government side The Moderates stand still at 17.5 percent, while the Sweden Democrats, who are not a government party but are part of the government base, increase slightly to 22.9 percent. According to Sjöström, the development means that Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson has an increasingly difficult path to re-election. - It looks very difficult. SD are very strong right now. The moderates stand and stomp and the support parties would fall out of a government if there were elections today, he says. Sjöström points out that a sitting government is often negatively affected by events in the outside world and by domestic problems. - Anything negative that happens will punish the current government. We have increased electricity prices, for example. SD can sit safely in the back seat, while the opposition benefits from the negative events that take place, he says. Belief in the future is decisive Sjöström believes that the political development in Sweden follows a broader pattern also in other western countries where uncertainty and anxiety dominate. - As the current government throughout the Western world, you are fighting against the negative reality. The most important thing is to try to build in faith in the future. If you succeed in creating hope, it can also give a little more tolerance towards the uncertain present, he says. The changes in the measurement are within the statistical margin of error.

## "Grab my daughter - hid us under the bed"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-18 (1 day old)

An explosion has occurred in an apartment building in Rinkeby in northern Stockholm. Walls are damaged, several windows have been broken and the gate is destroyed. The exact same gate exploded yesterday, which TV4 Nyheterna reported on. But now the bang was much stronger. Neighbor Oliver: "Don't know how I'm still alive" Oliver lives in the stairwell with his wife and one-year-old daughter. He was sleeping when it struck. He looks out over the facade and says it looks like the war game "Call of Duty". - I don't know how I'm still alive, I was sleeping in the corner there. If you look, you'll see my bed, Oliver tells TV4 news and points. He continues: - I was very tired, because we didn't get any sleep after the explosion yesterday. The next thing that happens is that I see myself grabbing my daughter and we are hiding under the bed. How are you? - I don't know. What are you going to do now? - I have no idea. But I won't stay here. It doesn't work if you get bombed every night. I am from Albania and have seen many bad things there, but to see it in Sweden... I came here because it was a nice country, but my experience has been different. The police appeal for witnesses Daniel Wikdahl, press spokesperson at the police, says that it is "completely understandable" if those who live in the area feel worried. - So it is the same gate and stairwell that have been hit two nights in a row. Last night's blast was much stronger than yesterday's, says Daniel Wikdahl, police spokesperson. The police are now working on mapping evidence. - There is some kind of connection. Which it is, we cannot answer at the moment. The police are on site in Rinkeby during the day with security and crime prevention efforts. - If you know something or have seen something, we want you to call, says Wikdahl. The landlord can change the windows again today Jonas Hagström, security coordinator at Victoriahem, made sure to change all the windows that were destroyed yesterday. Now he needs to repair them again, less than a day late
