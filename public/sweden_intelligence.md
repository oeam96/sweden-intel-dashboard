## Trump attacks the halftime show: "Terrible"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-09 (today)

There was a tense atmosphere before this year's final in American football at Levi's Stadium outside San Francisco.  But that had nothing to do with the game, where the Seattle Seahawks crushed the New England Patriots 29-13 to claim their second Superbowl title. The focus was on the halftime entertainment, where Bad Bunny from Puerto Rico provided the main number. The Reaggeton artist was the most streamed artist on Spotify last year and is an outspoken Trump critic.  During the performance, several famous artists appeared, including Lady Gaga and Ricky Martin. In addition to performing his most famous songs from the album "Debí tirar mas fotos", Bad Bunny finished by listing a number of countries from Central and South America and saying "god bless america".  He also carried an American football with the text "Together we are America". In the background, the text "The only thing more powerful than hate is love" appeared on the big screen. Alternative half-time entertainment In response, conservative Turning Point USA organized an alternative half-time entertainment with, among others, Trump friend Kid Rock. Before the game, Trump's press secretary Karoline Leawitt said the president would rather see that concert. But apparently it didn't happen that way.  - No one understands what this guy is saying, and the dancing is disgusting, especially for young kids watching this in the US and around the world. This "show" is just a slap in the face to our country, Trump writes on Truth Social. Bad Bunny is from Spanish-speaking Puerto Rico, which is part of the United States.  Confirms romance rumor Racing driver Lewis Hamilton was also spotted in the stands with Kim Kardashian, confirming rumors that the pair are dating.

## The expert explains: This is how the pension is affected by your vaping
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-09 (today)

The fact that you lose income by babbling is perhaps not so strange. Money from Försäkringskassan covers just under 80 percent of the salary and there is also a cap on how much money you can get. But for the vast majority of people, vaping does not have a very large impact on the future pension, according to the Pensions Authority, which believes that it is sometimes presented as vaping can be a big sink. Vabb affects the pension to a very small extent. The allowance from Försäkringskassan is pensionable, although it may be slightly lower than the salary. In addition, the employer usually continues to pay into the occupational pension, which is therefore not affected, says Monica Zettervall at the Swedish Pensions Agency. Part-time a criminal According to the authority, it is a matter of relatively few kroner a month in reduced pension calculated over an entire working life. The pension system has built-in airbags which mean that parenthood affects the pension very little, says Monica Zettervall. What rather affects the pension is, among other things, how one chooses to share the parental allowance and the unpaid work in the home, for which women take responsibility to a greater extent. Part-time work is a factor that affects the long term. If you work part-time for more than four years when the children are small, it can start to be felt in the pension. During the first four years, there is pension entitlement for childhood years in the general pension system, which largely compensates for the loss of income.  Small difference Generally, high income earners in the private sector are affected more than those with low and medium incomes in the state and municipality, according to Zettervall.  The call from the Swedish Pensions Authority is not to worry too much about the pension when you are at home with a sick child. Most people who open their orange envelope won't see much of a difference because you've vacillated. I think it creates a lot of unnecessary anxiety, says Monica Zettervall.

## A: The government's big investment is just a "figure trick"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-09 (today)

Just in time for the election year, the government is coming forward with several initiatives aimed at women.

Maternity care is now at the center of the political debate. During the latest party leader debate, KD leader Ebba Busch attacked Magdalena Andersson (S) on the issue of maternity care and women's health. - If you compare the social democratic efforts during the whole eight years, they still do not reach what has been achieved during the last three years, said Ebba Busch, among other things. Tidöpartierna invests on a national level One of the crown jewels of Tidöpartierna's investments is a national plan for pregnancy, childbirth and aftercare. Recently, the government issued a press release stating that it is now making a "major investment" in maternity care and women's health. Among other things, it concerns targeted government support to the regions of around SEK 1 billion. But in previous years, the corresponding money bag in the state budget has been around SEK 1.6 billion. Health Minister Elisabet Lann points out that the government is putting money into a number of areas related to women's health, in addition to maternity care. - We are allocating SEK 200 million to care for victims of sexual violence. We are also putting half a billion extra into cancer healthcare, where breast cancer is the most common form of cancer. It is also great means of shortening the queues for prolapse operations. It is something that only women demand and need, she says. S criticizes the government for fiddling with numbers But the Social Democrats in the Stockholm region are now storming against the government's measures - which they consider to be fiddling with numbers. - The Swedish healthcare system has gone through a national healthcare crisis with great notice around the country. We know that it is the healthcare staff who are the most important resource in healthcare in order for us to shorten care queues and provide care as needed. The government must also see that, says Aida Hadzialic (S), regional councilor in Stockholm. - The entire Swedish healthcare system needs more resources. Our operating rooms, our medical centers

**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-08 (today)

At the end of the summer, Defense Minister Pål Jonson (M) and Ukraine's ditto Denys Shmyhal signed a declaration of intent on a joint production of military equipment in Sweden. Just over two weeks later, it announced to German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius that Germany will help Ukraine develop drones that can strike targets deep inside Russia. Now the plans are about to be realized - at least in Germany. This is stated by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a post on X. "As early as mid-February, our drones will be produced in Germany," says Zelenskyy. Opening export centers in the Nordic countries The venture in Germany is one of several similar production lines in Europe, the president states. In the UK, production is said to be already underway. In addition to arms production, Ukraine will open a total of ten export centers in the Nordic and Baltic countries during the year. It is not clear exactly which countries are covered, but the Reuters news agency has previously reported that similar centers have been opened in both Copenhagen and Berlin in order to export the surplus from the joint production of weapons. - This is about co-production and export of the weapons that we can allow ourselves to sell in order to bring in more money for our own production of things that we lack and do not have money for, Zelenskyy told Reuters. Explosive increase in drones Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost four years ago, the country's investment in the defense industry in general – and drone production in particular – has increased explosively. In another post on X, Volodymyr Zelenskyj states that Ukraine now has 450 different producers of drones, of which 50 are world class. Together, they make up the largest industry currently operating in the country, according to the president. "Aviation is one of the promising investment areas in Ukraine. Everyone wants to invest," says Zelenskyy. Production is not Ukraine's only success on the drone front. Recently, Elon Musk's space company SpaceX announced that it was shutting down

## The participants clash in the Farm: "It's never okay with personal attacks"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-08 (today)

It all starts with host Anna Brolin asking the Farmen participants as they sit around the table if there is anyone who makes them feel very bad. She is met with silence at first.  - I don't think anyone dares to talk, because when you talk, you become the one that everyone opposes, says the participant Nathvadi "Pim" Kwampaiboo and continues: - We had a great time when Alex and Bosse were here, but as soon as they arrived, Jonas changed and said that we were fake. Things have happened and all of us here have a sister, a daughter, we are women - somewhere there has to be a moment where you say stop. No one dares to take a stand and we are ostracized.  - But seriously, she cries five times a day. It's so sick, says Jonas Ackelman.  Anna Brolin is allowed to break in. Then a dispute breaks out between Pim and Jonas. Where Pim says that he has made her feel bad "since day one" and Jonas says that he thinks she is "a fake person". This means that presenter Anna Brolin has to break in: - I just want to make it very clear that personal attacks are not okay. Personal attacks will never be okay here. You are all different, but you also have to accept that some may also have different emotional states, you can be different sensitive. You also need to learn to show respect for that, says Anna Brolin.  In sync, Pim and Jonas both speak out about the quarrel.  - Something in me happens when he laughs at me and says that I cry at least five times a day. I sat and looked at everyone who has commented on how they feel about Jonas and I just hoped that someone would dare to say something, says Pim.  Jonas says that he can't deal with fake people - and that there are some in the Farm that he "strongly dislikes".  "Thinks it's completely sick" But it doesn't end there, because Nils Karlsson appoints Jonas as "first champion".  - It became Jonas because I had to make a decision to get a functioning working environment with acceptable conditions for the participants here. Someone has to take responsibility, then it has to be me, says Nils.  U

## Several fatal accidents in avalanches: "Mode to be extra careful"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-08 (today)

Since the start of this year's ski season, more than 50 people have died in avalanche accidents in the Alps, according to the European Avalanche Warning Services (EAWS). Last Saturday, four people died in two separate avalanche accidents in Italy. The reason behind the fatal accidents can be several, and the snow-poor winter that prevails in large parts of the Alps is likely one of them. Less snow means that the snow is less compacted, and in addition weak layers of snow can remain for several weeks. - They are difficult for the common man to follow - and also for professionals, says Petter Palmgren, avalanche expert at the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency. A catalyst for accidents In addition to weather, a large proportion of accidents can be explained by the human factor. The majority of avalanches that occur are triggered naturally, but the avalanches that lead to deaths are almost exclusively triggered by humans, says Petter Palmgren. Statistically, accidents increase the more people are in the ski systems, and therefore the combination of newly fallen snow and snow-poor winters is a bit of a catalyst for accidents. - When a little snow finally falls, many people are starved for good skiing. Large avalanches are then quite common. Until the beginning of February in the previous two seasons, a total of 28 and 30 people respectively lost their lives in avalanche accidents in the Alps, according to figures from EAWS. This year, there have thus been almost twice as many fatal accidents within the same time period. - It's probably quite a lot for the time of year, says Petter Palmgren. "It's not a good idea to go off-piste" According to Petter Palmgren, off-piste skiers, top tourers and to some extent climbers are responsible for almost all avalanche-related deaths. Especially off-piste skating is popular among Swedes, and the sports holiday is just around the corner. - It is time to be extra careful if you go off-piste or go on a trip in the Alps during the sports holiday. These are risky activities that require preparation. Read up on the weather conditions and forecasts, and think about what you can and can't handle. It can go very quickly from feeling undramatic to a

## Nazi graffiti has exploded in schools: "Sense of belonging"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-08 (today)

Far-right graffiti in Stockholm's schools has increased by 140 percent in the past three years, according to Stockholm city statistics reported by P4 Stockholm. At Skarpnäck's elementary school, racist stickers and swastikas have been discovered. The school management has urged parents to talk to their children about what happened. According to Christer Mattsson, researcher and expert on right-wing extremism and violence at the University of Gothenburg, the increase is neither unique to Stockholm nor a new phenomenon. - The behavior with doodles is something that goes in waves, he says. "Generates a curiosity" He links the development to the attention that has been around new far-right groups in recent years. - I would interpret it as being related to the attention that has been around new extreme right-wing groups, not least the active clubs, which in turn generate a curiosity and then you move that aesthetic out to the outside world. Similar graffiti waves have been seen before in Sweden, according to Mattsson. He points to the 1960s and the so-called squint epidemic. - The first wave was named the swastika epidemic where swastikas start to be scribbled everywhere and actually led to the first school effort in Sweden to raise awareness about the Holocaust. Today, doodling is not always about clear swastikas. Instead, more subtle symbols and number combinations are often used. - In a subculture, you would like to have symbols that you in that culture understand, but which are more difficult to understand for others. It creates a sense of belonging. Nazi memes An example is the number 14. - It is from an old Nazi slogan, it becomes 14 words, and this has been around for a long time. It is something that recurs and is reproduced in different contexts. At the same time, Mattsson believes that graffiti in a school environment is often connected to a wider exposure, above all digitally. - What is much more constant and at a much higher level, are the memes that appear on social media. Then you take the step Facing the messages repeatedly can have consequences, both for them

## The DNA solution came too late - the killer who got away
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-08 (today)

On October 13, 2005, Marie Johansson was found dead in the fabric store Stuvkällaren on Kyrkogatan in central Gothenburg. Early on, investigators had both DNA and witness information about a woman in a black jacket and pink sweatpants, but despite extensive efforts, the killer went free for almost two decades. - One week, then it's solved, they said. A week passed, then two weeks passed, then a month passed, then three months passed, then six months passed, then a year, says Marie's sister Birgitta Borén in The Murder of Marie - that's why the killer goes free on TV4 PLAY The DNA finding was decisive The police were convinced for a long time that the case would be solved quickly. The coroner found clear repulsive injuries and the perpetrator had left traces of blood after cutting himself during the attack. Anders Eriksson is involved when the police in the West start a new cold case group in 2016 and the murder of Marie is one of the cases that the group takes on. - In terms of investigation, it is not a complicated matter in view of the forensic evidence. If we find the person who has deposited his DNA through blood, then it is the perpetrator, he says.  The big turnaround Despite phantom images, surveillance footage and tips from the public, the breakthrough was delayed. Only in 2022, when a woman in her 40s was busted after a minor theft, was her DNA matched to the findings from the murder scene. The police were sure they had found Marie's killer.  But the joy was short-lived. The woman was only 17 years old at the time of the murder, and the statute of limitations for murder of minors was then 15 years. The DNA meeting came about two years too late - and no trial could ever be held. - It's bad for everyone. There is no winner in that it has turned out the way it has with these rules, says Anders Eriksson. Sentenced for new crimes The woman who the police are sure is guilty of the murder was recently sentenced to prison for aggravated theft against the elderly in her work in home care. But she has never spoken publicly about Marie's murder.

## GW: "The defense insists that he did not live a normal life"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-08 (today)

Marius Borg Høiby is charged with, among other things, rape, assault and several other crimes. The trial began this week and is heavily covered by the media. In total, the indictment covers 38 points and the negotiations are expected to last for several months, partly behind closed doors. According to Leif GW Persson, there is a clear risk that the extensive reporting affects those who must take a position on the evidence. - There is, of course, a significant risk that it affects them. In this case, it is not to the benefit of the person charged, namely the bonus prince, says Persson in Nyhetsmorgon. Compare with the Dacosta trial Leif GW Persson draws parallels to Swedish legal cases where massive media attention had consequences for the legal process. He specifically cites the Dacosta trial as an example. - Justice feels good about being able to work in peace. But it won't be allowed to do that here, he says. According to Persson, the situation is further complicated by the fact that Høiby's mother, Crown Princess Mette-Marit, has recently been linked to the Epstein affair.  - It has nothing to do with his case, but it comes as an additional burden. He also seems to be feeling very unwell, and it is not to his advantage either, says Persson. Extensive prosecution - but uncertain outcome Among the 38 charges are four suspected rapes, one assault and crimes such as drug offences, vandalism and various forms of molestation. According to Persson, Høiby has partially admitted to some less serious crimes, but denies the assault and rape. - He will not be convicted on all counts. If he goes all the way, he risks up to 16 years in prison, but that will not be an issue, says Persson. He is also doubtful whether the trial will even lead to a prison sentence. - I am not even sure that he will be sentenced to prison. But I dare not speculate. "Not extenuating" According to Persson, the defense has emphasized Høiby's upbringing and that he lived most of his

## The professor's grim words: "Very likely to fall apart"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-08 (today)

On Wednesday, SVT Norrbotten reported that the steel group Stegra has unpaid invoices of several hundred million. A day later, Otto Gernandt left his role as the company's CFO to take on an advisory role. The announcement from the green steel company is ominous, says Ossi Pesämaa, assistant professor of accounting and management at Luleå University of Technology. - Key people abandon ship, it's quite critical. A total of around SEK 70 billion has been invested in the green steel project. As a comparison, industry colleague SSAB's has a market capitalization of just over SEK 76 billion. - Stegra's loans are thus almost as large as one of Sweden's largest industrial groups. Add to that that Stegra is not even fully built, and in such a complex industrial plant there will be many elements and uncertainties even after completion, says Ossi Pesämaa. May need to double the loans According to Ossi Pesämaa, Stegra's facility is about 60 percent complete. Construction costs have skyrocketed and port construction has been put on hold. The financiers turn a blind eye. - Now you have applied for ten billion more, but if you are only halfway there, maybe another 70 billion is required - and maybe a little more. Where are they going to find that money now that the trust capital is at the bottom?, asks Ossi Pesämaa. Stegra's situation is increasingly reminiscent of bankrupt Northvolt. Stegra is structured in the same way and, just like Northvolt, has been able to show order books as security for financing. Now they are burdened - just as the battery law did - by multibillion-dollar debts and a trust that has run to rock bottom. - I think it is very likely that this will fall apart. The problem: Optimism bias Steel production worldwide accounts for around eight percent of global carbon dioxide emissions. In Sweden, the figure is around ten percent. It is therefore no wonder that green investments such as Stegra have gained popularity. In working condition, it would be a hyper-modern company with doubled steel production with non-existent colds

Already as a child, Mikaela had intrusive thoughts, but it was after she became a mother in 2021 that everything got worse. She describes how the anxiety around sleep and worry about harming her child took over her whole existence.

- I could only think if I had hurt him without remembering it. The thoughts took up all my waking hours, says Mikaela. Didn't dare to be alone with her child In the end Mikaela was on sick leave. She sought help in the psychiatric ward when she felt she no longer wanted to live.

- I was afraid of hurting my child and did not dare to be alone with him. I wanted someone else to always be there, she says. The turnaround came after she was admitted to psychiatry last fall. A new medication allowed her to relax for the first time in a long time.

- Without the medications, I don't think I would have been sitting here. They enabled me to adopt CBT and learn to manage my thoughts, says Mikaela. Support from other mothers Mikaela has chosen to be open about her OCD and received strong support from others, especially mothers who recognized her story.

- The guilt and shame is great when it comes to one's children. But many people have contacted me and said that they experience the same thing, she says. Today, Mikaela works part-time and can be with her son without the anxiety taking over.

- I enjoy more, plan things and can be present. Before, I was just trying to survive – now I'm living, says Mikaela Eklund. Effective treatment is available Christian Rück, senior physician and professor at the Karolinska Institutet, emphasizes that there is help available.

- There is good hope for good help, he says.

## The weather causes chaos in the regular traffic - buses break down from the cold
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-08 (1 day old)

This winter has been marked by storms, snowfall and low temperatures, which has led to extensive traffic disruptions. Several bus companies have been forced to cancel trips when the vehicles could not cope with the cold. Among other things, travelers in West Sweden, Skellefteå, Luleå and in other places have been affected.

In Östersund, the temperature has periodically approached minus 30 degrees. This has led to it becoming too cold inside the buses for both drivers and passengers, which has forced companies to cancel departures. - It's not good. I think that as a traveler you can make high demands that the buses can handle the cold and not be cancelled. And that they must also manage to keep the timetable, says Christina Hellblom in Östersund.

Simon Dickens, site manager at Vy bus in Östersund, regrets the situation. - Yes, it is regrettable, above all for the travellers, he says. Challenges for the bus companies The question of why the buses cannot cope with the cold comes up frequently. - Yes, one might think so. But we don't have bus manufacturing up here in Östersund and have to buy in buses that are manufactured in other places. And we have chosen the best buses available, in our opinion, says Simon Dickens.

He emphasizes that the company does its utmost to avoid canceled tours. - We do everything we can so that it doesn't have to happen, says Simon Dickens, site manager at Vy bus in Östersund.

## The country's poorest are used as cannon fodder in the war
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-07 (1 day old)

The BBC's Russian editors, together with the news organization Mediazona and a team of volunteers, have analyzed Russian soldiers who died in the war in Ukraine.   According to open sources, 173,477 Russians have been confirmed killed in the war since the full-scale invasion in 2022, but the figure is estimated to be up to 385,500 people.  There is a clear pattern among the fallen; the poorer, the greater the risk of dying. Renat Mukmenov from the city of Chita in southeastern Russia was in a deep debt crisis, when the regime increased the regional one-off payment for signing contracts with the army from 250,000 rubles to 400,000 rubles, equivalent to about 50,000 kroner. Renat Mukmenov was sent to the front in the summer of 2024, and in mid-August communication ceased. - I suspect that the number of people considering signing a contract and going to war will only increase as the Russian economy slows down and wage increases slow down, says Alexander Kolyandr, visiting researcher at the Center for European Policy Analysis to the BBC.  15 times higher chance of dying The area of ​​Zabaikalsky kray, where Renat Mukmenov came from, is one of the poorest regions in Russia and, according to the analysis, has one of the highest rates of fatalities per capita. Residents of the region are 15 times more likely to die in the war than residents of Moscow. - Calm in the capitals and the North Caucasus has traditionally been very important for maintaining social order and stability in Russia, says Alexander Kolyandr. There are a couple of exceptions to the analysis. In some of Russia's poorest regions – Chechnya, Ingushetia and Karachay-Cherkessia – deaths per capita are on a par with the rich cities of Moscow and Saint Petersburg. Sent to the front instead of trial Over half of all dead are voluntary, mobilized or convicted criminals from correctional facilities. People who had no connection to the army before the outbreak of war. Defendants in criminal cases have fallen among the dead, compared to a year ago.

## Moved to tears after the final place: "Damn how embarrassing"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-07 (1 day old)

It's been over 20 years since they last competed in Melodifestivalen - first with the classic "Kom och ta mig" and the following year with "15 minutes" - but the glow has not been extinguished. Brandsta City Släcker's "Rakt in i elden" has been the favorite from the start and now goes directly to the final. The band's orange firefighter uniforms have also stood the test of time. - These are our original clothes since "Kom och ta mig" and they have ridden the fire truck with us before that, singer Glenn Borgkvist has told. In the pyrotechnics-dense number, where flames lick the edge of the stage and fly in the air almost constantly, it gets really hot in the thick jackets. Drummer Tom Börjesson has stated that it is important to get enough liquid. - We have heard that beer is supposed to be the best. Moved to tears It was a moved Felicia who wiped away the tears and barely managed to sing the opening of her song "My system" when she was presented as a finalist. - You mustn't cry, what a shame, she said on her way up to the stage. Felicia has been a favorite from the start with "My system", which has more techno and house vibes than her previous songs in the epadunk genre such as Fröken Snusk. The artist himself has speculated whether it might scare viewers away. - I think the song is one that goes better outside Sweden, she has said. She last competed in 2024, then with the song "Young & free" - which went on to the final qualification but fell on the finish line and missed the final. Then she felt mentally ill and the feeling is completely different now, she has told TT. - It cannot be compared to last time. I feel so good now and am so busy. It feels absolutely fantastic. Former Melodifestival winner Robin Bengtsson, who is participating for the fifth time, clinched the place in the final qualification with the country song "Honey honey". Sung gospel Melodifestivalen's second competition, which takes place in Gothenburg, got off to a flying start in the form of a gospel number. Hampus Nessvold, backed by a choir, sang about how Melodifestivalen is his religion. Previous win

## Special weather phenomenon uncovers 17th century ships
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-07 (1 day old)

In Stockholm the water level is 60 centimeters lower compared to normal levels and in Skellefteå the level is down to almost 80 centimeters. - We have a powerful high pressure that has been over Scandinavia for a long time, says Madeleine Westin, meteorologist at TV4. The high pressure literally pushes down the water, which is pushed out of the Baltic Sea. In Stockholm, the water level is now the lowest in at least 15 years, according to SMHI.  17th century wreck visible The weather phenomenon has caused the Orlogsfartyget at Kastellholmen in Stockholm to look forward. The shipwreck from the 17th century is 40 meters long and usually lies below the surface of the water. The ship has not been wrecked, but sunk on the spot, which means that the ship is very intact.  - When it was no longer worth repairing the ships, the navy reused the material and sunk them. It's a cool phenomenon, instead of using new wood, they use old ship scrap, says Jim Hansson, marine archaeologist at the Wreck Museum to Dagens Nyheter. But the low water levels have also caused it in its parts. Around 20 piers have been pulled into the Stockholm archipelago because the boats cannot dock. It is also difficult for the boats to dock at Strömkajen because the angle of the gangway is too steep. - Absolutely, it causes it, we have some piers where the boats cannot dock, says Helene Jakobsson, business area manager for sea traffic. But boat traffic is among the lowest of the year and Helene Jakobsson is not particularly concerned about the inhabitants of the archipelago. - There is an awareness of the power of the weather when you live out in the archipelago, she says. The pressure will release next week The long-term high pressure over Sweden will slowly but surely move away and turn into a low pressure. - The water level looks like it will drop another couple of days ahead, then turn around in the middle of the week, when the weather will be more low-pressure based according to the forecast, says Madeleine Westin. But even that can create problems, according to Madeleine Westin. As the ice spreads across the Baltic Sea, bridges can

## The lawyer about Åkesson's Dumpen swish: "Up the walls"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-07 (1 day old)

After Sara Nilsson, one of the founders of the pedophile hunting site Dumpen, was convicted of defamation, the Sweden Democrats party leader Jimmie Åkesson swished money to her. He has also offered that SD should pay for the entire damages and legal costs, a sum of over half a million. Star lawyer Kristofer Stahre is now directing harsh criticism at Åkesson and SD. - If a crime is committed and the politicians do not agree with the legislation, they step in and pay the penalty. It sounds completely off the wall, he says to TV4 Nyheterna. "Fish in murky waters" He believes that the politicians should instead change the law if they are not satisfied with the legislation. - It sends completely wrong signals to the Swedish people. The fact that some people are above the law about it means that Jimmie Åkesson does not agree with the legislation. The lawyer sees major problems with the idea that one should be allowed to slander people if what is said is true. - That assessment is always made after the fact, and it risks affecting an awful lot of innocent people. Tidö has opened for a change in the law Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson (M) has previously opened for changing the defamation legislation so that, for example, you can warn neighbors about sex offenders in the neighborhood, something Stahre thinks you should be careful about. - I am afraid that you are fishing in cloudy waters. It is votes you are looking for before the election. You don't see the risks, says Kristofer Stahre. Jimmie Åkesson defends the payment in a debate article on Expressen. He calls the verdict a "judicial scandalous splash" and believes that Swedish defamation legislation has become a "protection for predators". Åkesson: "Pull where the pepper grows" Jimmie Åkesson responds to the criticism in a post on the platform X. This is what he writes: "Pull where the pepper grows. Yes, it is unconventional as a legislator to pay a fine to an individual who has committed a crime. But, those of you who choose to focus on that instead of the absurdity of an honorable citizen being convicted for doing the morally right thing can pull the trigger
