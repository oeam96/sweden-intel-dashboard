## Sweden gives 10 million to democracy fighters in Iran
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-07 (today)

The government condemns the deadly violence against peaceful protesters and the widespread, arbitrary detentions that took place in the wake of the protests.  As a clear indication, the Iranian ambassador has been summoned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where Sweden underlined the right of the Iranian people to express their views. Support via Sida - recipients secret The new support is to be channeled via Sida and directed to human rights activists, democracy advocates and other actors who work for increased freedom of expression in Iran. The government does not want to go into exactly who gets a share of the money. - For security reasons, we cannot go into details about which people or organizations it is about. But like all aid, we have very strict regulations to ensure that the money ends up right, says Dousa. The support can be used, among other things, to strengthen the security of people who peacefully work for democracy and human rights, says Minister for Aid Benjamin Dousa (M) to TV4 Nyheterna. Pressure against Iran to increase At the same time, Sweden wants to see continued heavy international pressure against the Iranian regime. The government supports new EU sanctions against regime representatives who were involved in the deadly violence against protesters.  Sweden also welcomes that the EU countries have now agreed to list the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as terrorists - a demand that the government has pushed for for a long time with the support of a unanimous Riksdag. - No one can do everything, but everyone can do something. We are at the forefront now in Europe and hope that more countries will follow with similar support, says Dousa.

The government's announcement comes at the same time as the protests in Iran continue to be met with harsh reprisals from the regime. According to the government, the support is a clear signal that Sweden stands behind the Iranian people in the fight for freedom, democracy and human rights.

## So many Swedes want nuclear weapons: "Surprising support"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-07 (today)

After Donald Trump threatened to take Greenland militarily, fundamental questions have been raised about how Europe should protect its borders. Such as whether it is still possible to trust the USA, or possibly it is time for Sweden to build up its own nuclear deterrent. - Not to show the power like the USA, that we have this, and sort of show the shoulders and muscles. But as a defense for a country that has fought for so many years to become the strong Sweden that it is right now, says Marya Osman. - That can be an argument, but at the same time we have allies who have nuclear weapons. So nuclear weapons should deter, and it won't if everyone has them, says Roger Wilhelmsson. Higher support than expected In a survey conducted by Novus with 1,007 respondents, 68 percent recently said no to Sweden acquiring its own nuclear weapons to increase its security. But 17 per cent positive was still higher support than expected, according to the head of research for the FOI's nuclear analysis programme. - People's concerns are expressed in this, and it's not entirely unreasonable. That doesn't mean the doors to everyone are open to anything right now, so to speak. But it is probably a reflection of the fact that we have a challenging security policy situation where people are willing to reconsider previous positions, says Karl Sörenson, head of FOI research. At the same time, new nuclear weapons programs have a high price. According to Sörenson, Europe should primarily deepen cooperation with France's and Great Britain's already existing programs, but primarily continue to build up its conventional defense capabilities. Difficult situation for the USA Sörenson also points out that, despite Trump's actions, the USA continues to guarantee NATO's nuclear deterrent, and preferably does not want to see a too strong Europe there. - The spread effect that would then occur might not only be in Europe but contagion and spread further in the world, it would create a situation that is much more complicated even for the United States to handle, if many countries in the world acquire nuclear weapons. So for the US it is probably in many ways better to have it that way

## Here, Nooshi Dadgostar (V) runs away from TV4 News' questions
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-06 (today)

In January, a basket of apples, decorated with cartoon portraits of Adolf Hitler, as well as a bloody IS doll were placed outside the residences of Aid Minister Benjamin Dousa (M) and Migration Minister Johan Forssell (M). Images from the action were spread by the Rojava Committees, which support Kurdish autonomy in Syria.  During Friday, charges were brought against an activist in the group, suspected of illegal threats and grossly illegal threats. The man denies any wrongdoing.

Municipal politician Showan Shattak in Malmö has expressed support for the action, which has led to criticism within the Left Party. Despite the party leadership's call to resign, Shattak has continued support locally, according to Dagens Nyheter.
The Malmö call has led to a split in the Left Party, according to the newspaper - something the party leader does not claim to be aware of.

- I have no knowledge of this, says Nooshi Dadgostar (V) to the newspaper. Sharp criticism of the party leader Civil Defense Minister Carl-Oskar Bohlin (M) calls Dadgostar's answer "completely substandard" and writes on X that she came up with an "obvious lie".

When Dadgostar left the meeting at the Government Office, TV4 Nyheterna tried to get a comment about the conflict, but she got into one of Säpo's cars and left the scene without answering. "We have to go on," said one of the party's employees, as Dadgostar left the scene.

Afterwards, TV4 Nyheterna sent written questions to the Left Party. The party's press office replies: "In our party, the party secretary and party districts are responsible for internal dialogue. Beyond that, we have no further comment at this time." "Hiding from the media" Bohlin continues to direct sharp criticism at Dadgostar: - You can easily get the impression that Nooshi Dadgostar is hiding from the media in this matter and that's enough, but what she is mainly hiding from are large parts of her own party, Bohlin tells TV4 Nyheterna. - Her party association in Sweden's third largest city supports threats and actions against ministers in the government.

## The Minister of Health is critical: Ivo should have acted more forcefully
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-06 (today)

Their testimony about abuses at the Eliva Clinic has shaken IVF care in Sweden. In total, there are now close to 30 former patients who have sounded the alarm. Today, some of the women who participated in Kalla fakta's report Barnmakarna were invited to a meeting with Minister of Health Elisabet Lann. - I was incredibly deeply moved by their story. It has played a role that they tell and dare to step forward, says Lann. Unscientific treatment methods Cold facts have revealed, among other things, that Eliva sold unscientific treatment methods and failed to report medical injuries to Lex Maria.  Eliva believes that all their treatments are medically justified, and that no patient has been harmed at their clinic. But today the former patients had to give their picture to the minister. - It felt like she was listening. Our goal is that no woman should have to go through what we did and we really believe that the meeting will have an effect, says one of them, Iris. A health care scandal Health Minister Elisabet Lann calls what happened at Eliva a major health care scandal and during the meeting took up two measures to prevent it from happening again: Firstly, it should be easier for patients to determine which treatment methods are approved by offering them knowledge support. It is a question that is now on the Board of Health and Welfare's table. Elisabet Lann further believes that Kalla fakta's disclosure has also brought up the issue of licensing requirements for private healthcare companies. An investigation into this is ongoing. - This would mean that everyone who is currently a care provider would have to be approved in order to get this permit. It is a way to get rid of unscrupulous actors, she believes. Elisabet Lann reacts strongly to the fact that Eliva has not made a single patient-related Lex Maria report in five years despite repeated serious incidents and care injuries at the clinic. She directs criticism at the supervisory authority IVO - They should do their job and not settle for records that are deficient, but there is obviously documentation here that should

## The municipality's proposal: Sex at work - as health care
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-06 (today)

The proposal, which has attracted a lot of attention, means that intimate activities can count as wellness, something SVT Dalarna was the first to report. The Center Party in Älvdalen, which is behind the proposal, writes, among other things, in a motion: "The wellness hour must be used for any health-promoting activity, including voluntary and consenting intimate togetherness" They are also clear that this must take place in ways that respect legislation and the work environment. Several politicians in the municipal board supported the proposal and hope that the initiative will lead to both better health and more residents. But Suzann Larsdotter sees both opportunities and risks. Voluntariness and integrity in focus According to Larsdotter, it can be positive to raise questions about sexual health and intimacy, especially since many couples find it difficult to find time for closeness in everyday life. - In my clinical everyday life, many people find it difficult to find time, so maybe this could make it easier, she says in Efter fem. At the same time, she warns that political initiatives in the area risk becoming normative and putting pressure on residents to have children. - It can become a bit problematic when the municipality somewhere puts pronatalist pressure on the population and somehow urges that it is an obligation to have children, says Suzann Larsdotter. "A way to get some attention" Larsdotter believes that the proposal is primarily a way to create debate and visibility ahead of the upcoming election year. - I think this was a way to get some attention to politics. They got quite a lot of media attention through this proposal, she says. She also points out that there are practical and ethical issues to consider, and that employers must protect the privacy of their employees. - It should be about privacy and maybe it shouldn't be personnel policy at work, says Suzann Larsdotter.

## Trump deletes ap video on the Obama couple - after massive criticism
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-06 (today)

The video Trump shared on Truth Social reiterates the long-debunked conspiracy of fraud in the 2020 US election, when Joe Biden won. At the end of the AI ​​video, former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle Obama depicted as monkeys appear. "The lion sleeps tonight" is played in the background.  Now the clip has been removed after massive criticism. Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the US Senate, wrote on X that it was "the most racist thing he's seen from this White House." "Disgusting behavior by the president" Hakeem Jeffries, the group leader of the Democrats in the House of Representatives, called Trump "disgusting, unrestrained and malicious" in a statement. "Every Republican must immediately condemn the repulsive bigotry of Donald Trump," he continues. California Governor Gavin Newsom writes on X that the clip is "Disgusting behavior by the president". Trump's press spokesperson Karoline Leavitt first wrote that people should "stop with their fake outrage", but now Trump has taken down the clip. Comparing black people to monkeys is a centuries-old racist image.

## Frustrated employees sound the alarm: "The county board is complicit"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-06 (today)

The investigation into the suspected misconduct at the County Administrative Board in Norrbotten is led by a prosecutor at the National Anti-Corruption Unit together with the police's anti-corruption group. According to information to TV4 Nyheterna, the authority is suspected of covering up nearly 200 possible environmental crimes by not reporting the incidents to the police. The majority of cases are linked to LKAB, SSAB and Boliden Mineral. TV4 Nyheterna has now spoken to employees at the County Administrative Board in Norrbotten. - We have long been very frustrated about this very thing, that you don't file a police report when it comes to environmental crimes. There are several of us who are very critical of how the County Administrative Board handles suspected environmental crimes, says a person at the authority. The suspicions of malfeasance at the County Administrative Board came to light when the police received a report about one of Sweden's largest diesel spills - just over three years after it occurred. In connection with that investigation, the police discovered another 200 unreported suspected environmental crimes. - It should be enough that the County Administrative Board has a suspicion of environmental crime, then a report must be made. Then the police can investigate whether it is or not. We should not sit at the County Board and investigate whether it might be an environmental crime or not. And it takes a long time. In some cases the police report is not submitted, in other cases it has taken two or three years to submit a police report, says an employee to TV4 Nyheterna. "Nothing happens" Several people with insight tell TV4 Nyheterna that the County Administrative Board's long delay in reporting suspected environmental crimes, when it is reported, among other things complicates the police's preliminary investigation and that the police are then several years behind in the investigation. - Partly that. But even then, these activities that caused the environmental crime are allowed to continue and continue to pollute or whatever it is they are doing. In that way, the County Administrative Board becomes complicit in making things worse, says an informant at the authority. It is managers at the authority who must report possible environmental crimes etc

## The find in customs: Ancient space rock - disguised as a garden ornament
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-06 (today)

Russian customs authorities have stopped an unusual smuggling attempt: a huge fragment of a meteorite that was to be brought to Britain, disguised as a garden decoration. This was stated by the Federal Customs Service on Thursday. The gray space rock, which weighs over 2.5 tons, was discovered during a routine inspection of a sea container in the port of St. Petersburg.  In the export documents, the cargo was described as a garden sculpture, but when customs officials took a closer look, it quickly became clear that something was not right - neither with the object's origin nor its true value. Cargo worth SEK 38 million The fragment is believed to come from the world-famous Aletai meteorite, one of the largest known iron meteorites on Earth.  In a video released by the authorities, customs personnel can be seen breaking open a wooden box and exposing the massive stone, with a rough, gray and uneven surface. According to Russian customs authorities, the meteorite fragment could be worth around 323 million rubles – equivalent to almost 38 million kroner. 4.5 billion years old Who is behind the smuggling attempt has not been made public, but authorities confirm that the destination was Britain. A criminal investigation has now been opened by prosecutors. The Aletai meteorite was discovered in western China back in 1898 and is estimated to be at least 4.5 billion years old – almost as old as the solar system itself.  Scientists have long warned about the growing trade in meteorites, which are often invaluable to research and can provide important clues about the early history of the solar system.

## SAS plane about to take off from taxiway - expert: "Very serious"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-06 (today)

On Thursday evening, SAS flight SK2590 rolled out towards the runway at Brussels airport with destination Copenhagen.  The aircraft began to accelerate, reaching about 200 kilometers per hour, according to FlightRadar.  Suddenly the pilots realized they were on the taxiway, the road used to get out to the runway. They were forced to cross, veered left and ended up in the grass. - It is very serious, says aviation expert and former SAS pilot Björn Lundström. He believes that it could have been much, much worse. - A car could have come out on this taxiway or another plane or other traffic, he says and adds: - Then they would have had a collision. Deadly examples In commercial traffic, it is very rare for aircraft to take off from the taxiway. But there are examples. Last year, a Boeing 737-800 was aborted from takeoff after air traffic control at Orlando airport discovered they were on the taxiway.  Björn Lundström also raises a tragic example from 2000. At the airport in Singapore, a passenger plane bound for Los Angeles began to take off from a closed runway.  The plane collided with construction machinery and equipment and 83 people died.  Swedes on board Several KD politicians were on the plane.  - As I understand it, it would have been difficult to stop the plane if we had driven five more seconds, says Dan-Ove Marcelind (KD) to Expressen. According to him, the staff was stressed because the flight was heavily delayed.  - Stress is a risk factor for a pilot, you know that, so you should be extra vigilant, says Björn Lundström. He is surprised by the incident. The taxiway is marked with completely different lighting and signs compared to the runways.  Björn Lundström also says that the aircraft probably had a map in the cockpit with the exact position.  He believes that the responsibility lies with the pilots. - You have to question yourself all the time.

## Was surreptitiously filmed naked for years - denied compensation: "Unfathomable"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-06 (today)

A former school employee in Haninge municipality was charged in September with sexual harassment after filming 50 girls naked, including in changing rooms. The suspected abuses took place between 2009 and 2013, and at the end of May last year, over 160 former students at the school where the teacher worked received letters from the police stating that they are plaintiffs in the investigation.  Now the Södertörn district court announces that the prosecution will not be tried, because the teacher was convicted in 2023 by the Svea Court of Appeal for several cases of child pornography crimes. The penalty was three years and six months in prison - a sentence he is still serving. - The films in this case were included in the previous indictment, but the plaintiffs were then unidentified. If the prosecutor had wanted to test how it happened when the films were recorded, this would have been investigated before charges were brought for the possession of the films, says councilor Fredrik Nydén, who was the court's chairman.  The district court has also ruled that the surreptitious filming, which the man admitted, does not fall under the criminal classification of sexual harassment, which was required for the plaintiff to receive damages. This means that all claims for damages have been rejected. "Hard to find words" Hanna Charlton is one of the 50 affected girls. She is 22 years old today. - That the verdict resulted in zero extended sentence and zero kroner in compensation to the victims is completely unimaginable to me, given what he has actually done to us over so many years. I have difficulty finding words for this, she says to TV4 Nyheterna. Although the legal process is aimed at the individual man and the crimes he committed, Hanna thinks that other actors also have a great responsibility in this. For example, Haninge municipality - which Hanna feels has put "the lid on". - I would have liked the municipality to now step forward, be straight-backed and actually apologize to those affected. A 30-second apology in an interview is not enough. I would also like an answer to what concrete strategies and measures have been put in place to ensure that this never happens

## "Sorrow and frustration - Sweden forgets the children"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-06 (today)

The verdict was expected, says Sara Nilsson. - If we had lived in Norway, Denmark or Finland or England, it would have been him who was sentenced for having a sex chat with someone he thought was a child. But now we live in Sweden and the legislation is not enough, on the contrary we prosecute those who disclose, she tells TV4 Nyheterna. The verdict will be appealed, Nilsson announces. She believes that Dumpen has worked for several years to bring about a change in the law.  - In the midst of all this, we have children who feel terribly bad, who harm themselves and who cannot be rehabilitated. That's how tragic it can be. We're talking about children who can't protect themselves, that's where we adults need to intervene, not grown men who feel violated, she says. The man: Feeling very bad It was a couple of years ago that Dumpen confronted the man, who the site claimed had sex-chatted with a 14-year-old. The man was then publicly hanged and the post was widely circulated. After the publication, the man stated that he felt very unwell and was unable to work. He therefore chose to sue Dumpen's responsible publisher. The district court now sentences Sara Nilsson for gross defamation to a suspended sentence and 60 day fines. She must also pay SEK 43,100 in damages to the man. "Sweden forgets the children" Sara Nilsson is critical of the man now being awarded damages. - The Swedish state is probably quite alone in providing these gentlemen with money so that they can buy new hardware so that they can continue to look for children online, she says and continues: - It is sadness and frustration. Sweden forgets the children.

**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-06 (today)

This year's flu season peaked at the beginning of January and then declined sharply, figures from the Public Health Agency show.  But now the trend has turned.  The number of confirmed cases and patients in intensive care is increasing. - We'll see if it's just a temporary bump in the curve and it goes down in the future or if there will be an increase again, says Magnus Gisslén. Klara Sondén, deputy state epidemiologist at the Public Health Agency says that the rise is quite expected after the Christmas holidays. - We are all on site in schools and workplaces. You have many contacts, so it is easy for the infection to spread from person to person. The Public Health Agency predicts that the spread of influenza will continue in the coming months.  It is the new aggressive mutation H3N2 that dominates the spread of infection right now.   - It can escape our immune system a little easier than other variants precisely because it has changed so much. The effect of vaccines is also slightly worse on this variant. Winter sickness on the rise As far as winter sickness is concerned, the peak has not been reached. The spread of infection is on the rise and the number of confirmed cases at the Public Health Agency is higher compared to the same period last year.  Everything indicates that the spread of infection continues to increase, it will take some time before the curves start to turn downwards. - You can count on it to increase now for a number of weeks until March, says Magnus Gisslén. The Swedish Public Health Agency urges you to wash your hands thoroughly and stay home if you are sick.  If you have symptoms of a respiratory infection, remember to show special consideration to the people who are at risk of becoming seriously ill. This applies even if your symptoms are mild.

## Olle from Brandsta City Släckers injured: "Must improvise"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-06 (today)

It was already during Wednesday's rehearsals that Olle Östberg from Brandsta City Släckers injured his hand. The band was supposed to ride a fire pole down on stage, but because they had much heavier equipment than you normally have as a firefighter, Olle injured his hand.  - There are things that happen, but he is not allowed to ride the pole on Saturday, says band member Glenn Borgkvist to TV4 Nyheterna.  Olle Östberg was forced to sew four stitches and Brandsta had to redo the number. Among other things, they are introducing a "Brandsta dunk" instead of the classic "Brandsta clap".  - He's not allowed to pole now, but that's what happens - you have to improvise a bit. We'll work it out, but he'll be damned if we have to cast his whole hand.  Haven't been in Mello for 23 years Brandta City Släckers haven't competed in Melodifestivalen since 2003 and thus become one of the year's biggest comebacks to the competition.  - It's crazy fun, completely crazy but great fun. It could be that we weren't interesting anymore, but we've gotten a lot of attention so it's great fun. We are tagged, says Glenn Borgkvist.  Together with band members Mats Nilsson, Ulf Johansson and Tom Börjesson, Olle and Glenn perform the song "Rakt in i elden" in Melodifestivalen's second competition.  - It's a song with a lot of joy, it's "smoke n' roll 2.0", but it sounds like 2026 and it should, says Glenn Borgkvist to TV4 Nyheterna.

## The savings expert's happy message: "It speaks for an interest rate cut"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-06 (today)

Swedish inflation has thus fallen below the Riksbank's target of two percent, which may have an impact on future interest rate announcements. According to Frida Bratt, it is above all the strengthened krona that contributed to imports becoming cheaper and thus pushed inflation down. The Riksbank's next step - I think this suggests that the next step will be a decrease rather than an increase. There has been talk of an increase, but now we see that inflation is coming quite far. It comes below the inflation target of two percent, says Frida Bratt. She believes that low inflation partly shows that growth has not picked up, which may lead to the Riksbank wanting to support the economy by lowering interest rates. At the same time, it may take some time before a possible reduction takes place. - Even if the next step could be a reduction, it could take a while. You want to wait and see: Will growth pick up in the Swedish economy and thus also inflation? Inflation measure in focus CPIF excluding energy (KPIF-XE) is often used to give a clearer picture of the underlying inflation, as energy prices are difficult to influence. If energy prices are included, inflation lands at two percent. - You would like to look at what is moving underneath if you ignore the energy prices and count them out, very relevant to look at, says Frida Bratt.

## Tricked into taking a job as an electrical engineer - risks becoming cannon fodder in Russia
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-05 (1 day old)

After being promised a well-paid job in Russia, Francis Ndung'u Ndarua was instead forced into military service and sent to the front in Ukraine after only three weeks of training. In December, a video was published in which Francis warns other Africans: - You will end up in the military even if you have never served, and you will be sent to the front. Many friends have died for money, Francis says in the video. Viral video shows abuse Soon after, a video of Francis spread on social media. In uniform and with a land mine strapped to his chest, he is threatened by a Russian-speaking person who says that Francis will be used as a "can opener" to advance Russia's positions.  According to CNN, more and more Africans are being lured to Russia with promises of high wages and citizenship. Twelve African soldiers from Ghana, Nigeria and Uganda, among others, tell CNN that they were promised civilian jobs, but once in Russia have been forced to sign military contracts in Russian without an interpreter.  Many have had their passports confiscated and have not received any salary. - I have been here for seven months and have not received a cent, says one soldier anonymously to CNN. A soldier CNN spoke to believes that the African soldiers are given the most dangerous assignments at the front. - When you have stepped into the Russian army, you will either flee or die, says recruit Patrick Kwoba to CNN.  African governments warn Several African governments, including in Uganda, South Africa and Kenya, have warned that their citizens are being tricked into the war.  Ukraine's ambassador to Kenya, Yurii Tokar, also calls on African countries to stop recruitment.  - If they are at the front, they are our enemies, and Ukraine will defend itself. This recruitment channel must be stopped.

## Jagland is being investigated following revelations in the Epstein files
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-05 (1 day old)

Between October 1996 and October 1997, Thorbjørn Jagland was Norway's Prime Minister as party leader of the Labor Party. He has also served as secretary general of the Council of Europe and as chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee.  Now Norway's ecocrime authority has decided to investigate him, following suspicions that he was guilty of ecocrime in his contacts with Jeffrey Epstein. - We have decided to start an investigation against Thorbjørn Jagland, says Pål K. Lønseth, head of the Norwegian Ecocrime Authority, to NRK. More specifically, they are investigating whether Jagland received gifts, trips and loans while he was chairman of the Nobel Committee and secretary general of the Council of Europe. Want to waive immunity There is, however, an aggravating circumstance. Jagland has immunity for his former role in the Council of Europe. The ecocrime authority now wants the Norwegian Foreign Ministry to lift that immunity, reports Dagbladet. "Because Jagland has immunity as the former head of an international organization, Ekokrim has asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to take the initiative to lift the immunity," the authority writes in a press release. Norway's Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide agrees with the Ecocrime Authority that Jagland's immunity must be lifted. - It is important that this issue is clarified. Then Jagland's immunity cannot stand in the way of an investigation. I have therefore decided that Norway should present a proposal to the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers that Jagland's immunity should be lifted, says the foreign minister. Taking the investigation in stride Thorbjørn Jagland's defense lawyer, Anders Brosveet, however, takes the accusations against his client in stride. He tells VG that they will cooperate with the investigation and submit the requested documentation. - And based on what we have found, we are calmly looking at the outcome. It is first and foremost good for Jagland to get an authoritative clarification from Ekokrim, rather than the entire press corps carrying out its own little private investigation, says Brosveet.  Emails in the latest Epstein files show, among other things

## More and more people are asking AI for dating advice - the psychologist: You should think about that
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-05 (1 day old)

According to an American study, one in four singles in the United States, and almost half of Generation Z, use AI to, among other things, analyze messages when dating online. One of those who use AI as a springboard in their dating is Dilara Chakali. - When I went to therapy, I felt: One hour a week was not enough for me. I wanted to reflect more. I wanted to understand myself more, how I function in dating, says Dilara Chakali in Efter fem. "Not so strange" Dilara Chakali says that she uses AI to get straight answers, but emphasizes that it is she herself who decides which advice she takes to heart. - I want "the ugly truth", she says.  - Then of course I choose how I act on it. I want to believe that I have the self-awareness that I don't act on everything it says, she says. Psychologist Maria Farm believes that it is a natural human behavior to ask for advice. And in this way, it is understandable that more and more people are using AI in these matters. - I think it is a natural consequence. That it is there and that we also use it in psychological matters, I don't think that is so strange in itself, says Maria Farm in Efter fem. The psychologist's advice: See it as a supplement Farm sees no major problems with using AI as support, but urges you to ask yourself the question for what purpose you are asking a question, as it can become destructive in the long run if you constantly have to ask and cannot make decisions yourself. - I have many clients who are a bit anxious, full of anxiety and they sometimes need to practice not actually asking so many questions about it, it could be the relationship, but it could also be their own health.  - With me, they get to practice standing up for their own opinion or maybe not asking for completely certain answers all the time, adds Farm. Maria Farm recommends that AI be used as part of a larger palette when it comes to big decisions in life. - If you are thinking about something as big as divorce, also ask a person. It doesn't have to be a therapist, but some wise person you trust

## The demand: Canada should choose the Jas Gripen
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-05 (1 day old)

Don Davies, who is acting party leader of the Canadian Social Democrats, is now demanding, together with Canada's Green Party, that the purchase of the F-35 be scrapped. The Jas Gripen is a far better and more cost-effective alternative, it is believed.  The proposal by Saab to sell the Jas Gripen to Canada should be adopted immediately, Opposition Leader Davies said at a press briefing in the Canadian Parliament in Ottawa last night, underlining that the situation is serious. Reduced dependence on the United States The play is done against the background of Canada's decision to expand its air combat forces with 88 new planes. 16 of these, F-35 Lightning from American Lockheed Martin are already booked and ordered. But there is now an intense debate about the remaining 72 combat aircraft; which plan to choose? Concerns about the reliability of the United States as a partner have grown in Canada following Donald Trump's repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state of the United States. The opposition now also points out that Prime Minister Mark Carney himself in his famous speech in Davos recently emphasized that Canada must act more independently and reduce its dependence on the United States and invest more in cooperation with medium-sized countries. 

- If Mark Carney completes the purchase of the F-35, it proves that his statements in Davos were just a PR stunt, says Don Davies. Saab hopes for production line Yesterday's marking from two of Canada's opposition parties comes at the same time that Saab announced at the Singapore Air Show that the defense group is considering establishing a production line in Canada that can serve not only Canadian needs but also build Gripen planes for other countries. - If we were to win in Canada, we would not only build for Canada. We would see it as a hub for exports, said Mikael Franzén, head of marketing for Saab's Gripen program at the Singapore Airshow yesterday. He also said that Saab hopes for a production rate of 36 Gripen E/F aircraft per year by utilizing more than just the current production countries Sweden and Brazil. An opinion poll recently
