## Rama, 10, is one of the few who can leave Gaza for treatment
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-11 (today)

Rama rides up and down the elevator at the Specialty hospital in Amman, Jordan. She's only been here for two weeks but is already finding herself in the huge hospital. - Here I can come and get dialysis without all the noise of bombs, airplanes and helicopters, she says in a firm voice. She is one of the few children evacuated from Gaza for care. Right now, several different organizations believe that between 18-20,000 patients need to leave the Gaza Strip to receive better care. Last Monday, the Rafah border between Gaza and Egypt was opened and many hoped to be able to go to a better hospital outside Gaza.  But the process is both slow and complicated, which has meant that only around 100 patients plus their relatives were able to leave in just over a week. The patients in Amman have gone via the Kerem Shalom crossing, through Israel to Jordan. - The process is extremely slow, difficult and cumbersome. The king of Jordan has said that we will help 2,000 children but so far we have only managed to get 650 children out. I'm afraid that many will die because the wait is so long, says Fawzi Al-Hammouri doctor Specialty hospital. War injuries and a long wait The patients who have come to Amman are a mixture of children with war injuries, cancer or who need internal medicine.  Inside the physiotherapy, we meet the sisters Sarah, 15 and Saraa, 17. They were both badly injured when the house fell on them after a bomb attack in northern Gaza. Saraa was injured in the knees and operated on in Gaza and can now walk relatively well. But Sarah, who injured her neck and spine, could not get help on the spot. - I couldn't move my arms or legs. But it took 6 months before I could be evacuated from Gaza. Here in Amman they operated on me and through physiotherapy I have regained some of my strength, she says. Both sisters study remotely and want to become doctors and physiotherapists. - After what we have been through, we want to use the experience gained to help others, says Saraa. 10-year-old Rama will probably stay in Amman for a long time. Both her mother and uncles have children

## Selling songs - for billions
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-11 (today)

The deal is believed to be worth 200 million dollars, equivalent to just under 1.8 billion kroner, sources tell TMZ. In 2021, Spears' 13-year guardianship ended, giving her the right to control her own finances. Wrote few of her own songs All of Britney Spears' biggest hits were written by others than herself, including Swedish star producer Max Martin, who has the rights to the composition. What Britney Spears is now selling is the right to the recording itself and the opportunities to make money from it. - The songs that most of us associate with Britney Spears she did not write herself, they were written by Max Martin, says music journalist Fredrik Strage and adds: - If she had 100% rights to all the songs she had hits with, it would be much more.  A way to bring in money and get the music out Several famous artists have sold catalog rights in recent years. Among others, Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan have sold their catalog for around 500 million dollars. - It's a way to bring in money but also to get someone else to work on it. Get the music out in commercials or in other contexts, says Strage. Why Britney Spears now chooses to sell her songs is unclear, but Strage points out that she doesn't seem interested in performing live anymore. - She wrote last January on Instagram that she will never perform live in the USA again, a little unclear why.  In the last ten years, she has not produced a new album either. - I don't know what her plans are now, other than dancing on Instagram, says Strage.

## Expert: "Don't exploit children"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-11 (today)

About ten young people that TV4 Nyheterna has spoken to testify that door-to-door sales companies deliberately recruit young people. According to the young people, they are being asked to give a false picture of what the proceeds from the sale will be used for.

- You must not give the appearance that you are selling something on other premises than what it is. You must not say that I am selling for a certain purpose when it is a completely different purpose that I am selling for. Then you mislead consumers, says consumer advisor Maria Wiezell. The sellers lie about sales In several of the reports that TV4 Nyheterna has seen, it is described how the sellers state that the money from the sale goes to, for example, the class fund or savings for a driver's license.

But according to the reports, this is not true.

One of the notifications comes from a high school teacher in southern Sweden. The teacher writes that students at the school have told about the scheme and is sharply critical of the company's methods.

"It feels disgusting that they partly target minors and use their desire to earn a little money to cheat private individuals out of money and extract an outrageous profit through this". Should be investigated further The approach is not completely new, but according to Maria Wiezell, the procedure should be examined more closely.

- Around 30 reports should be an incentive for the Swedish Consumer Agency to look into this, especially when children are also being exploited.

At the same time, she points out that the responsibility for reporting misleading sales often lies with consumers - something that can be problematic. In many cases, they do not know that they have been deceived. Who is responsible? According to Maria Wiezell, the responsibility clearly lies with the employers, which she believes is problematic from several perspectives.

- You must not use children to go around and mislead consumers. It violates the marketing legislation and it also violates how to use children in a sales context, she says and continues:

- In this case, yes

## The decision on night trains in Norrland raises concerns: "A serious threat"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-11 (today)

In Gällivare, the sports club's wrestlers train in the basement of the bathhouse - an activity dependent on the night trains to be able to participate in competitions in other locations. Jona Dervishi, coach in Gällivare SK, emphasizes the importance of the night trains for the club's business.  - It's super important, we live where we live and are far from everywhere. We always aim to go by train because it is the safest way to travel. We have competitions in Sundsvall, Västerås, Falköping, Gothenburg and various camps. The night trains affect our business a lot, says Jona Dervishi. Reduced opportunities for sports Traveling at night also means that the children do not have to take time off from school to travel to the competitions. The alternative of flying is too expensive. When the night trains north of Umeå are reduced from two to one, it becomes more difficult to find tickets that suit the club's needs.   - This means fewer competitions and it leads to fewer wrestlers, so our business will be significantly reduced, says Jona Dervishi. According to the government, the change is due to SJ taking over night train traffic at short notice at the end of 2024, which was expensive for the Swedish Transport Administration. The government has pushed for money, but no earmarked for double departures north of Umeå.   - It is, of course, important that there are good conditions for accessibility within and to and from Norrland and that is why the government allocates large funds to this type of procured traffic and we have pushed to a quarter of a billion since 2025, but at the same time it is important to get a handle on these costs, they cannot continue to rise and that is why the Swedish Transport Administration has been forced to this emergency brake. But the government has also tasked the Swedish Transport Administration with reviewing both the organization and financing of the state's night train fleet for the future, so we have a long-term solution to this, says infrastructure minister Andreas Carlsson (KD). Have been forced to pull the emergency brake Isn't it the government's job to secure train traffic throughout the country? - The government pushes to significant amounts, a quarter

## Trump's hard pressure on Zelenskyi: "He is forced to bend and bow"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-11 (today)

The plan is for an election to be held by May 15 at the latest, otherwise Ukraine may risk losing the security guarantees that the US previously proposed. Several sources told the newspaper that President Zelenskyi will announce the election on February 24, the anniversary of the full-scale invasion. A high voter turnout is required At the same time, several sources state that the timetable is somewhat optimistic and that several factors affect whether it can actually happen, including how far you can get in the negotiations for a peace agreement. Zelenskyj has previously stated that it is not possible to hold an election when the country is in a state of emergency. Around 20 percent of the country is occupied by Russia and a large number of the country's citizens are on the run.  The pressure to hold an election is said to come from the United States, which reportedly wants to see an end to the war before mid-term elections in November. - They say they want everything ready by June, so that the war ends, says Zelenskyj and adds: - They want a clean schedule, says Zelenskyj, referring to the time before the mid-term elections.  One source states that at least half of the voters who were registered before the full-scale invasion must participate in the election - otherwise it may lack international legitimacy. Something that Russia could exploit.  "He must bow to Trump" TV4 Nyhetern's foreign commentator Johan Fredriksson believes that Trump and the American negotiators have been fed lies from Russia about an "illegitimate Nazi regime" ruling in Kiev. - Now Volodymyr Zelenskyj must in practice refute the lies and show the USA that his government has the support of the people. This despite the fact that Ukraine's constitution and election laws prohibit the conduct of presidential, parliamentary and local elections as long as the country is in a state of war, says Johan Fredriksson. At the same time, he believes that Zelenskyi has no other choice.  - He has to bow and bow to Trump and his ideas and now the White House has set an ultimatum: first carry out elections, then an agreement on military security

The alarm came in around 1:20 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon, local time. Six people were found dead inside the school, and one person died on the way to hospital.

## Only one letter writer left at Marcus' farm: "Not so damn easy"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-10 (today)

Marina Westerlund found it difficult to relax on the farm and also did not feel that she received any confirmation from the farmer Marcus Andersson. Even though they had both talked about there being something between them, Marina Westerlund chose to go home. - It was a very special situation but I had a lot of fun and it was both educational and developmental, she tells TV4 Nyheterna. In the program, Marcus Andersson expresses that Marina Westerlund was his favorite of the three remaining girls - something that surprised her. - I am very shocked by what Marcus said. It would have been good if he told me. But I don't regret my decision. I felt nothing for Marcus. I would probably have gone home anyway, she says.  Marcus: Wouldn't have made any difference For TV4 Nyheterna, Marcus Andersson says that he doesn't think it would have made any difference if Marina Westerlund had been told that she was his favorite. - I guess I didn't really feel right for her either. At least we wouldn't have been, that's what I can say.  At the same time that Marina Westerlund leaves the farm, Marcus Andersson expresses that he felt no tingle for the two remaining girls. - It felt a bit sad to hear, of course. But we had been there for such a short time too so it's hard to feel anything for anyone. It takes a little more to build and that's something that can come later when you get to know each other a little more, says Sofie Ingemarsson. Only one letter writer left After she leaves the farm, Marcus Andersson decides to send Louise Pettersson home as well. In the program she describes her participation as "the worst thing she has ever done". - Both Marina and Louise were nice and cute girls, but this is a very special thing. I understand that she found it difficult. But I think I did what I could. It is also difficult in one's own seat to pick up how everyone feels in different situations, says Marcus Andersson. "Not so damn easy to get it right" The result of this is that Sofie Ingema

## The monks have walked 370 miles for peace: "Something up to the young"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-10 (today)

The monks started the "Walk for peace" at the end of October last year from their temple in Texas. In total, they and the dog Aloka have walked over 370 miles before they now reach the American capital. - It's a bit like the great elk migration to follow these monks. What they create around them is very special, says Håkan Friedel, who is a Buddhist. Accidents and challenges on the way The walk has not been without difficulties. In Texas, a car crashed into the caravan, forcing one of the monks to have a leg amputated. In South Carolina, the dog Aloka needed surgery before he could continue. Despite the cold of the American winter, the monks have continued, often barefoot and sometimes without even lying down when sleeping. - These are very advanced donuts as far as I understand. So they take on a special exercise for themselves, for their own sake, to be able to reach deeper into themselves, says Håkan Friedel. Great commitment and meetings with politicians Thousands of people have followed the monks along the way and millions have become involved online. During the walk, they have stopped to talk to both ordinary people and politicians. - There are a lot of conflicts in America. It feels very right that the monks are out walking and talking to people. They stop and share what they have with them, says Håkan Friedel. The monks will participate in several events in Washington. They also plan to submit a request to Congress for the Buddha's birthday to be officially observed, although they themselves emphasize that the most important thing is meeting people. - Of course, the big overarching goal has been to walk for world peace, but it is undeniably the case, as a monk put it, that the goal has also been to get people along the way to stop and get distraction from the problems that weigh on them in everyday life, says Filip Jacobson, foreign correspondent.

## Clara has a phobia of food: "Sheer horror"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-10 (today)

Arfid affects an estimated 1–5 percent of the population. Unlike other eating disorders, Arfid is not about body ideals or weight, but about a strong reluctance or fear of food, often linked to taste, smell or texture. Klara Edlund, psychologist and researcher, emphasizes that Arfid is not about being picky or spoiled. - This is about a neurobiologically rooted eating disorder. It's about a strong inability to eat enough, which means you end up with both energy and nutritional deficiencies, says Klara Edlund. "It comes physically from within" Many people with Arfid describe a strong fear of negative consequences of eating, such as vomiting or choking. For Clara Lager, the fear has sometimes led to panic attacks and severe anxiety, even though she tries to have a positive attitude. - When that reflex comes and that discomfort comes, it's like I have no power over it. It comes physically from within. It's not something I get for myself, but I want to be able to eat like everyone else, she says. Treatment with CBT Klara Edlund urges you to seek help via a health centre, BVC or school nurse if you suspect Arfid in yourself or your child. Despite the fact that knowledge of Arfid is low, there is help to be had. Clara Lager herself has undergone cognitive behavioral therapy, CBT, which helped her approach new foods step by step. - It's about gaining an understanding of how you function, which foods are the easiest to approach, which situations would have made the biggest difference in everyday life, says Clara Lager.

## Bodström's criticism of Åkesson: Violates the constitution
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-10 (today)

After Sara Nilsson, one of the founders of the pedophile hunting site Dumpen, was convicted of defamation, the Sweden Democrats party leader Jimmie Åkesson swished her money. He has also offered that SD should pay for the entire damages and legal costs - a sum of over half a million kroner. The action is not only problematic, but it also violates the constitution, says lawyer and former Social Democratic Minister of Justice Thomas Bodström. It is clearly stated in the form of government that members of the Riksdag may not intervene in individual cases. - When he gets involved in how courts should judge by criticizing them, he has crossed a very important line. Politicians must not rule the courts. And that is precisely what we criticize Trump for all the time, he tells TV4 Nyheterna. "It's nonsense and everyone understands it" In a debate article in Expressen, Bodström writes together with lawyer Hanna Larsson Rampe that Åkesson's and SD's donations encourage a convicted person to continue committing crimes. "SD's rhetoric is that those of us who dare to criticize Dumpen's actions would rather protect the pedophiles than the children. It is nonsense and anyone who thinks about it understands that. Nor can they justify their actions by saying that sexual abuse of children is a heinous crime, because this is a view that basically everyone shares," write the lawyers. They also express a concern that Jimmie Åkesson may be part of a future government, and specifically as Minister of Justice - which the party leader has explicitly said he wants to be. - If you are in the government, you have enormous power and can pardon anyone without reasonable grounds. If he were to become Minister of Justice, he would, for example, have the right to pardon Sara Nilsson, says Bodström to TV4 Nyheterna. Åkesson: "We take the initiative to do it" Jimmie Åkesson has "no understanding whatsoever" of the criticism surrounding the Dumpen swish, he tells TV4 Nyheterna. - It is a way to signal very clearly that we think the defamation legislation is wrong and needs to be changed.

## Gangster arrested after sabotage - had the Russian coat of arms on him
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-10 (today)

The 30-year-old was detained last weekend by the Västmanland district court. During the hearing, the man admitted to the crime of sabotage and agreed to be detained. - He admits that he was there, that's what I can say, says District Attorney Magnus Möller, who has the case on his table. Arrested on the run The incident took place at 02.30 on January 30. The police were then alerted to Mälarenergi's facility in Västerås. The power at the Hässlö waterworks had been cut off after a sabotage against the electrical installations inside the protected area. A police patrol was able to quickly track down the saboteur and arrested the 30-year-old when he tried to run from the scene. According to information to TV4 Nyheterna, the man was wearing a cap with the Russian coat of arms when he was arrested. - We do not go into more detail about what information we have or what our cooperation with the Police Authority looks like in individual cases, says Jonathan Svensson, press spokesperson at the Security Police, Säpo. Unknown motive The 30-year-old man has appeared in the legal system since a young age and has a long criminal record with several serious crimes. He has been sentenced together with, among others, a well-known leader of a notorious criminal network and has been involved in high-profile gang cases. Säpo has previously come out and warned of increased threats of sabotage from Russia. However, the prosecutor does not want to comment on the information that the detainee had the Russian state coat of arms. - There is preliminary investigation secrecy, so I cannot go into details. I must point out that there will be a preliminary investigation protocol where it will appear, says Magnus Möller. According to the prosecutor, no motive behind the nocturnal sabotage has yet been discovered. - So far we don't have that. But he will be interrogated once more and it may become clearer then, says Magnus Möller. "Very serious" According to Mälarenergi, the sabotage did not lead to any impact on the quality of the drinking water. - But due to the power outage at the Hässlö waterworks on the night of January 30, the waterworks could not supply drinking water

## Tried to mislabel expired candy - five tons seized
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-10 (today)

When Malmö city inspectors recently visited a wholesale company, 5.2 tons of approximately one-year-old candy were discovered that were about to be relabeled with new best-before dates. This is reported by the news agency Siren. Two people who were working on packaging goods in connection with ten pallets of candy boxes immediately left the premises when the inspectors showed up, according to the environmental administration.  - We are doing outreach to inventory premises, including in this area, which is densely packed with wholesalers. When two people stick out immediately when we arrive, it of course arouses our interest, says unit manager Caroline Tandefelt to Nyhetsbyrån Siren. On a follow-up visit, those in charge stated that the candy had accidentally not been disposed of. "In the premises there were prepared packing surfaces, empty new cartons, unused bags for repackaging, tape, sealing machine and solvents in the form of acetone and nail polish remover with the aim of removing labels and erasing the best before date", writes the environmental administration in its decision. Cat chasing mice The spaces in the premises were also dirty and unhygienic. Among other things, a cat had been placed there to keep mice and vermin away. "There was a litter box in the toilet and cat food was stored in the fridge," the decision states. In recent years, the wholesale company has been the subject of several controls and banning decisions.  Contact with Danish colleagues The delivery in question, which according to the environmental administration had come from the Netherlands, is still taped up in the premises and is to be destroyed under the supervision of the municipality - We have also been in contact with our Danish colleagues on the other side of the strait. It is about a very large volume, and overall the data we have indicates a certain systematicity, says Caroline Tandefelt to News Agency Siren. The property where the environmental administration's raid took place is owned by another company with partly the same group of owners. Several wholesale companies in the food industry have their warehouses nearby.

## Livia went for the bench press record - then she broke both arms
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-10 (today)

The accident occurred during the bench press WC in Eskilstuna on January 25. After lifting 170 kilos, Livia Blomqvist, 23, tried to break the Nordic record of 178 kilos. During the lift, she heard a crack - and then another - as the bar ended up at the wrong angle and both arms broke. - Then it felt like in that second the dream of the World Cup came crashing down, says Livia Blomqvist in Nyhetsmorgon.  "The second time in my life I've heard of this" Blomqvist competed in the so-called equipped bench press, a technical branch where everything has to be right. She says that her shoulder blades gave way, causing the bar to go backwards towards her head. The arm ended up at such a bad angle that the leg came off and she lost control of the bar - then the other arm came off too.  Chief physician Mikael Sandström states that it is very unusual for athletes to break both arms at the same time. - It is the second time in my life I have heard about this, says Sandström. Despite the injury, Blomqvist managed to qualify for both the WC and EC, but now awaits a long rehabilitation.  - I try to maintain my body as much as possible and hope to be able to train lighter weights as soon as possible, she says. Tough way back Despite the setback, Blomqvist is determined to get back to the competition scene. She continues to train what she can and hopes that the injury may even give her body time to heal old wear and tear. - If only I can train 40 kilos in the bench press, it will do a lot for my strength, says Blomqvist. The doctors have prescribed at least twelve weeks of rest from heavy load, which makes the WC in May unlikely. Blomqvist is now aiming to be back at the EC in August. - You'll see how the body responds, but I've made up my mind that the EC in August is a more realistic goal.

## Sharp increase in defense spray - after the murders: "A security"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-10 (today)

Amanda Blom received her first defense spray from her father when she was only 13 years old.  - It is my father who has said that it is important since I was little, so then it has just followed me into adulthood, says Amanda Blom in Nyhetsmorgon.  In her social media, she has promoted defense spray, something that has led to a positive response from women who she states bought the product after her videos. From the men, the reactions have looked different. - They were very negative about my video and commented a lot. That we imagine that we are so vulnerable. They probably wanted to ridicule it a little in some way, says Amanda Blom.  Defense spray may be carried and used in Sweden for self-defense in an emergency situation. Johanna Björkman, legal expert, explains where the line is drawn between emergency protection and assault. - You always have to defend yourself against, for example, an unprovoked or ongoing attack. But you must never be the one who initiates something by starting to use this spray, for example unnecessarily or to ward off someone who may not have an intention at all or has misunderstood something, says Johanna Björkman.  "The body thinks it's burning" Defense spray is legal, unlike pepper spray, which is illegal to possess, buy or bring into Sweden. Chemist Johanna Thompson explains what the various products contain and how they affect the body.  - In both cases, it is a hijacking of the body's own defense system, says Johanna Thompson.  Pepper spray contains the active substance capsaicin, which is extracted from chili fruit.  - The body thinks it's on fire. It is an immediate, inflammatory, very strong reaction, says Johanna Thompson.  She also says that it can cause shortness of breath and lasting pain. Unlike pepper spray, defense spray instead gives signals of extreme cold.  - Here we have a base of menthol in most cases and solvents that will help the menthol to cross the protective membrane of the eye, says Johanna Thompson.  The risks of defense sprays Defense

## Trump's new move raises anger: It could endanger millions of lives
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-10 (today)

It's been in the works for a long time - but now it seems to be close.  The Trump administration plans this week to overturn a scientific decision from Barack Obama's time as president that is the basis for large parts of the United States' climate policy, The Wall Street Journal reports. If the decision is implemented, it will be the most extensive dismantling of the country's climate policy to date. It is about the so-called "endangerment finding" from 2009, where it was determined that six greenhouse gases pose a threat to human health and welfare. The decision has been the legal basis for the environmental authority EPA's climate rules, including emission limits for power plants and stricter fuel requirements for vehicles. - This is the largest deregulation in the history of the United States, says EPA director Lee Zeldin. Trump has called climate change a hoax Trump already tried during his first term to weaken or dismantle parts of the US's climate regulations. The American president has previously called climate change "the biggest hoax" ever invented by man. - The carbon footprint is a hoax invented by people with evil intentions, and it points the way to total destruction, he said in a speech to the UN General Assembly last year. The new decision, which is expected to be announced later this week, removes requirements for measuring, reporting, certifying and complying with federal emission standards for motor vehicles. Also associated control programs, credit systems and reporting requirements for the industry are to be abolished, according to the administration. However, the change does not apply to rules for emissions from power plants and other stationary sources, such as oil and gas facilities. But overturning the original decision could pave the way for those rules to be dismantled as well, writes The Wall Street Journal. The criticism: Could endanger millions of lives The fossil fuel industry is expected to be the big winner - which has long opposed federal climate regulations. Since Trump took office, he has provided

## That's how corrupt Sweden is: "We are the second worst in the Nordics"
**Outlet:** TV4 Nyheterna
**Category:** General News | **Date:** 2026-02-10 (1 day old)

Transparency International's index measures how corrupt a country's public sector is perceived by experts and business. The countries receive a score between 0 and 100 – where higher scores mean less corruption.

This year, Denmark, Finland and Singapore top the list, while South Sudan, Somalia and Venezuela end up at the bottom. Sweden gets 80 points, which is a clear drop from 89 ten years ago. Three areas stand out According to Transparency International Sweden, there are three areas that particularly affect Sweden's results. Organized crime with infiltration and illicit influence poses a serious threat to welfare systems. - It is about organized crime with infiltration, unauthorized influence, extortion and the like. Where companies are used as criminal tools, for example, says Ulrik Åshuvud.

In addition, Sweden lags behind in transparency and control in public procurement, where several cases of pure corruption have been noticed. - There is a lot of money in procurement. These are large public resources. Over a trillion, i.e. a thousand billion, is procured for in public Sweden today, says Ulrik Åshuvud.

Finally, conflicts of interest are raised, where the ability to refrain from participating in decisions is questioned. - The third thing that we usually talk about is conflicts of interest, that is, the ability to take a step back and realize that maybe you shouldn't be part of the decision-making process or that you shouldn't influence certain decisions, says Ulrik Åshuvud. Political integrity questioned Before the 2022 election, Kalla revealed the facts that five out of eight parties in the Riksdag were prepared to receive secret contributions to the election campaign, which may have affected Sweden's position. - That made us change our direction quite a lot. We didn't have any priority regarding political integrity, we probably thought it worked quite well. We can't say that it did then and maybe it still doesn't, says Ulrik Åshuvud. Several legislative proposals underway Today there are proposals and legislative amendments on boron
