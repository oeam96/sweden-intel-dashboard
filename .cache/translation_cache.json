However, it is clear that the Epstein scandal has now reached Starmer's absolute closeness, which means that other politics end up in the background.\n\nAnyone who follows British politics is used to loud headlines, fierce debates in the House of Commons and frequent ministerial changes. Now, however, everything revolves around the question of what the Prime Minister actually knew when Mandelson was appointed to the prestigious ambassador post in Washington.  In the House of Commons yesterday, Starmer admitted he was aware of Mandelson's contacts with Epstein after the 2008 conviction. But during the pre-appointment security clearance, Mandelson claimed he barely knew Epstein - a lie that led to his sacking over a dawn phone call on the US east coast last September.  Demands for publication In the House of Commons, demands are now growing to publish the documents that show how Mandelson was investigated before his appointment. Starmer supports the demand, but the police - who have opened a preliminary investigation against Mandelson - have stopped publication for the time being. Frustrating for the Prime Minister, to use his own words from today's press conference.  Starmer assures that he had absolutely no information about the close relationship between Mandelson and Epstein that he has today. Perhaps the Prime Minister of Great Britain should ask himself how the security clearance for one of the heaviest assignments in the foreign administration is done?\n\nDocuments from the US Department of Justice, consisting of both emails and photos, testify to close contacts between Epstein and the British heavyweight.  That Mandelson appears in the picture in old white underpants in Epstein's apartment in Paris is in this context a minor detail; significantly more serious is that he shared market-sensitive information and gave Epstein insight behind the scenes into London's political top echelons, including during the coalition negotiations in 2010.",

According to Jakob Hallgren, director of the Foreign Policy Institute, there is a great risk that a long period of disarmament will now stop – or reverse. - This is the first time since the early 1970s that there is no agreement regulating the number and use of the most powerful nuclear weapons between the two countries that have the most in the entire world, he says. Regulated the most dangerous weapons The agreement that is now expiring has been about limiting strategic nuclear weapons, above all intercontinental missiles that can be fired from the US at Russia - or vice versa. In recent decades, these agreements have led to a sharp reduction in the world's nuclear arsenals. - During these 50 years, they have gone from a maximum of 70,000 nuclear weapons down to 12,000 today. It is a result of successive reductions that are now stopping – or, in the worst case, reversing. According to Hallgren, the risks already exist today. One of the biggest problems is that the US and Russia can no longer agree on new agreements. Today, China is estimated to have around 600 nuclear weapons, but Hallgren points to information which claims that the country may be on its way to 1,000 or 1,500. - China is now the factor that makes it impossible to come to an agreement. The US has said it wants China on board, but the Chinese say no. Increased tensions - also in Europe When there is no agreement that regulates the most devastating nuclear weapons, tensions in the outside world also increase, says Hallgren. The expert emphasizes that even a limited use of nuclear weapons would have extreme consequences. - Even the smallest nuclear weapon would have completely devastating effects, with hundreds of thousands - if not millions - of people injured or killed. There are terrible effects of nuclear weapons. At the same time, there is still the so-called non-proliferation agreement, which came into force at the end of the 1960s and aims",

But the funding itself must still come from the countries' own, often already strained budgets. From Berlin to Dresden by high-speed train In the south of Berlin, a new railway line shines in the sun. Double tracks, high noise barriers and a nail-straight stretch to the south. It is Germany's newest high-speed line, which opened at the beginning of December 2025 and makes the journey between Berlin and Dresden ten minutes faster. The project took 20 years to plan and seven years to build – but without any delays. The next step is to extend the route to the Czech capital Prague. Then the travel time between Berlin and Prague will be reduced to two and a half hours, compared to almost five hours today. Such a project is exactly what the European Commission wants the member states to invest in. Underinvestment, cheap tickets and short-term thinking But according to Christian Böttger, it will take years before a similar project can be inaugurated in Germany – or in Europe as a whole. According to him, billions are missing to even renovate the existing railway. The funds that do exist are often used for short-term solutions or for politically popular measures, such as lowering the price of train tickets. In Germany, years of underinvestment are clearly visible. Only about 62 percent of the trains run on time. Sweden is average within the EU, but still manages better, with around 87 percent on time. - In such a situation, to believe that new high-speed lines will be built within 15 years is wishful thinking, he says.",

  "d39132ccb5849bd8b9e5720520d6590fbfc7245e": "Thursday evening and Friday can be messy in parts of Skåne. Previously, an orange warning for snowfall combined with wind has been issued for south-eastern Skåne, and in the southern and central parts of the county a yellow warning has been issued for similar weather conditions. The warnings apply from five o'clock on Thursday afternoon and extend until two o'clock on Friday afternoon. - In the south-eastern parts, there may be upwards of 20 centimeters of snow, locally more. There will also be a fresh to strong easterly wind - and then you know there will be snowdrifts in Österlen, says TV4 Nyhetern's meteorologist Peter Kondrup. \"Bare ground to half a meter of snow in no time\" Drift formation is a recurring problem in the open landscapes of Scania. Despite a snowfall of around 20 centimetres, the snow depth can vary significantly, which can affect both major and minor roads. - If you've ever been to Skåne, you know that it can go from bare ground to half a meter of snow in no time. There is nothing to stop the snow, but it drifts from one place to another and unfortunately often accumulates on the road. The advice is not to go out in traffic if you really don't have to, says Peter Kondrup. The last time there was an orange warning in approximately the same area in south-eastern Scania, a large part of the forecast was missed. - There were not as large quantities as feared and therefore there were not as many problems as had been expected. However, it remains to be seen how it will turn out this time – forecasts are forecasts, says Peter Kondrup. Risk of ice slippage Along the Öresund coast in the west, mild air will move in from the south, which can lead to freezing rain and ice slippage. - So it can be really noisy in Skåne tomorrow, with drifting snow in Österlen and risk of icy conditions in the west. In addition to Skåne, SMHI has issued a yellow warning for snowfall in parts of Halland and Västra Götaland counties. The warning applies from six o'clock on Friday morning and extends from just north of Varberg up to Trollhättan. During Friday, the weather moves north and in the West",

  "bb1fe796044e846e372c041cee147d3ccd82b4ec": "The National Board of Health and Welfare has gone through 98 cases where children and adults in the years 2019 to 2024 have been killed or subjected to serious violence. Among these there are 41 cases involving children and in half of those cases it is the child's own parent who exposed them to the violence. Is it a failure? - You have to say that. When we have gone through these 98 cases, they are cases that have fallen between society's safety nets and then suffered fatal violence, have been murdered or serious violence, says Björn Eriksson in Nyhetsmorgon. Difficult to put together the puzzle The survey adds to previous reports on intimate partner violence to identify where society is failing. - We know what the risk factors are. Often there has been contact with the health and medical services. The police have been aware of them and social services have been aware. But it has been difficult to piece together this complex picture as it has been. That is what has broken, says Björn Eriksson. The National Board of Health and Welfare points out that these are unusual, but very serious crimes. - The vast majority of parents do not harm their children and the vast majority of women are not killed by a partner. But every case is so serious. We have an obligation to better prevent, says Moa Mannheimer, licensed psychologist and investigator at the National Board of Health and Welfare. Must listen more to the children The authority has several proposals for measures that must be presented to the government. An important part is more collaboration. - We can see in retrospect that the police had certain duties, the social service had certain duties and the health care service others. But putting the puzzle together and assessing risks in a structured way - that has been missing in these cases, says Moa Mannheimer. Another measure identified is that the child's situation must be strengthened. - You need to listen more to the children's voice both within healthcare, the police and social services. We need to take steps forward and not always just listen to the parents' version, but also take in the whole, says Björn Eriksson.",

  "ac38a9d07d9b6a5d78a4425981f9df7e21faf9be": "A week and a half ago, Djurens vänner in Staffanstorp in Scania received an emergency call from a family who could no longer care for the 30 guinea pigs they had at the time. Actually, the animal shelter did not have room for more animals, but still chose to move in. - We still felt that the situation was so big. The family really needed help, says Linnéa Stålhandske, operational director of Friends of the Animals Skåne.  More guinea pigs than expected When the animal friends arrived at the family in Staffanstorp, they were greeted by more animals than expected – 40 guinea pigs and a turtle. Guinea pigs become fertile as early as three to four weeks of age, which means they can reproduce quickly if kept together.  - Then they often mate with those nearby. If it is then a mother or a sister, it will be inbreeding. To avoid further reproduction, all males have now been neutered. When the guinea pigs were taken into care, fur and claws were left behind. Among the guinea pigs was \"Grandma Rosiepuff\", the oldest guinea pig who is believed to be the mother of many of the others. - She is probably related to all of them. She is the oldest guinea pig we have received, says Linnéa Stålhandske in Nyhetsmorgon.  \"Looking for the perfect homes\" After the case drew attention in social media, the animal shelter has received many expressions of interest. At the same time, care is taken to only place the guinea pig with serious animal owners.  - We do not sell small animals to be kept in cages. We do not sell small animals to be toys for children, of course. So we look for the perfect homes.  Guinea pigs can live between five and ten years if cared for properly. They need large areas to move around, such as a paddock or their own room, and should never be kept alone. They require companionship, a proper diet of fresh vegetables and free access to hay.",

She makes bonnets, jewelery and art objects from reindeer antler, leather and wood for Jokkmokk's market. Despite the fact that e-commerce has grown in importance, the market is still the most important sales opportunity of the year for many Sami artisans. Combining crafts and reindeer herding Julia and many other Sami craftsmen combine crafting with reindeer herding. During the winter, spring and summer, reindeer husbandry takes up most of the time, while autumn is devoted to handicrafts. The work is long-term and already in the spring of the year before, planning begins for next year's market. - Yes, for me it is like that, at the market you sell for the whole year. After all, the market is the target, because it is precisely Sami craftsmanship that you want to see, look at and feel. So you prefer to buy on the spot, it's not something you just order. But you want to see what you get, says Julia Rensberg. Long-term planning for the future The materials, reindeer antler, hide and wood, for the craft often have to dry for one to two years in order not to crack and break during the crafting itself, which requires careful planning. Julia Rensberg emphasizes the importance of being careful with both materials and resources to secure the opportunities of future generations. - The material should ideally dry for one to two years, so this spring I started thinking about the market that will come in 2027. It takes time and you have to be careful both with materials and resources and think far ahead and also make sure that there is material left for future generations, says Julia Rensberg.",

Police in Arizona suspect she has been abducted from her home outside of Tucson and are investigating the incident as a crime. Nancy Guthrie was last seen late Saturday night, January 31, when she returned home to her residence. When she didn't show up at church the following morning, friends and family raised the alarm, and she was reported missing at lunchtime on Sunday. Demanding ransom US media have reported signs of a break-in and traces of blood in the home. However, authorities have been tight-lipped on details and have not publicly confirmed exactly what was found, citing the ongoing investigation. The incident has gained further attention after several media outlets, including TMZ, reported receiving messages demanding a ransom for Nancy Guthrie's release.  The police have not yet confirmed that the claims come from an actual perpetrator – but have not dismissed them either. \"When messages come to us, we treat it like any evidence,\" Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told CBS News. The family's plea Four days after the disappearance, Savannah Guthrie, along with her siblings, posted a video on Instagram in which they directly address the person who may be holding their mother captive. - We are ready to talk. But we live in a world where voices and images can be easily manipulated. We have to be absolutely sure she's alive. And that you have her. We want to hear from you, and we are ready to listen, she says.  She also tells us that her mother lives with constant pain and depends on her medicine to survive.  - Everyone is looking for you, mother, everywhere. We will not rest. Your children will not rest until we are together again, she says.

The government believes that this has led to people convicted of rape in some cases having to stay in Sweden. The government wants rape and other serious sexual crimes to always be considered extremely serious crimes when considering deportation. - Rapists must be able to be deported. It doesn't get any weirder than that, says Migration Minister Johan Forssell (M) to TV4 Nyheterna. Wants to get other countries on board According to Forssell, Sweden is the first to come out with the initiative, but the government hopes to get other countries on board, mainly within the EU and the Nordics. The work is now starting at the UN level and the process may be long, even if movement is hoped for already this year. - Sweden will soon have the toughest regulations in the Nordics for criminal deportations, but it is not enough. We also want to change the international framework, says Forssell. In parallel, the government is expected to present new Swedish legislation this spring, which could lead to more criminal deportations. The individual examination in court must remain, but the government wants rape to always weigh very heavily in the assessment. Dismisses symbolic politics The background is that Swedish courts, with reference to current practice and international conventions, in some cases judged that the crime was not serious enough for deportation. The government therefore wants to influence how the refugee convention is applied, including through changes in UNHCR's governing documents. Forssell dismisses the initiative as symbolic politics, but admits that the process can be both difficult and time-consuming. - This is work that has not been touched on for a very long time, he says.",

This is shown in a research report from AgriFood Economics, which is a collaboration between the Swedish University of Agriculture and Lund University. If the dietary change persists, it can make us sicker. \n\n- The fact that we reduce the intake of fruit and vegetables and also dietary fibre, has had a negative effect on public health. Above all, cardiovascular diseases could increase if we continued to eat this way over time, says Jonas Nordström, who is associate professor of economics and one of the report's authors.  Does not buy fresh fish Eva Ahlgren from Malmö shops with her husband and grandchildren at Ica Mathuset in Åkarp, Scania. She notes that they never bought very much fruit and vegetables, because the husband is not that fond of vegetables, but they buy less fish today than before the price increases.\n\n- Maybe frozen fish in that case. Fresh is very expensive, she says. \n\nLars Håhus, who is a regular customer in the store, belongs to those who have not changed their purchasing habits at all in recent years.\n\n- I'm as stingy as I've always been and buy what I want and what's the best price, he says with a smile.  Hitting low-income earners Jonas Nordström and his research colleagues at AgriFood Economics could also see that it was the cheapest goods that received the highest percentage price increases. A phenomenon known as \"cheapflation\".\n\n- It is often households with fairly small margins who choose the cheap products. In this way, it can be said that cheapflation and the inflation we have had have affected low-income households to a greater extent, notes Jonas Nordström.

This also applies to parts of the plot that belong to Bengt's hotel. - I thought: What on earth? It wasn't destroyed yesterday, but it happened this morning. I've never seen anything like it. - And it continues to blow. So it's great weather. Bengt Lundblad and the family also celebrated his 74th birthday at the same place. - Then we had sunshine and there were sunbeds and laps of sun. So there are tremendous contrasts. \"People stay inside\" When asked what the atmosphere is like in the village, the birthday boy replies that he doesn't know. - There aren't that many people out, so we don't meet that many. They stay inside, people down here. After all, they also warned us - we shouldn't go out, they said. But Bengt Lundblad does not feel particularly worried about himself. - We have a good hotel that stands firm, he says and continues: - You have to stay away from the sea. Now we are actually sitting in a restaurant by the sea. But it's on solid ground so it won't fall down. On Friday, the storm will subside and Bengt Lundblad and his family will remain in Calahonda next week as well. - So we hope for a few sunny days.",
