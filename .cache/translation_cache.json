However, it is clear that the Epstein scandal has now reached Starmer's absolute closeness, which means that other politics end up in the background.\n\nAnyone who follows British politics is used to loud headlines, fierce debates in the House of Commons and frequent ministerial changes. Now, however, everything revolves around the question of what the Prime Minister actually knew when Mandelson was appointed to the prestigious ambassador post in Washington.  In the House of Commons yesterday, Starmer admitted he was aware of Mandelson's contacts with Epstein after the 2008 conviction. But during the pre-appointment security clearance, Mandelson claimed he barely knew Epstein - a lie that led to his sacking over a dawn phone call on the US east coast last September.  Demands for publication In the House of Commons, demands are now growing to publish the documents that show how Mandelson was investigated before his appointment. Starmer supports the demand, but the police - who have opened a preliminary investigation against Mandelson - have stopped publication for the time being. Frustrating for the Prime Minister, to use his own words from today's press conference.  Starmer assures that he had absolutely no information about the close relationship between Mandelson and Epstein that he has today. Perhaps the Prime Minister of Great Britain should ask himself how the security clearance for one of the heaviest assignments in the foreign administration is done?\n\nDocuments from the US Department of Justice, consisting of both emails and photos, testify to close contacts between Epstein and the British heavyweight.  That Mandelson appears in the picture in old white underpants in Epstein's apartment in Paris is in this context a minor detail; significantly more serious is that he shared market-sensitive information and gave Epstein insight behind the scenes into London's political top echelons, including during the coalition negotiations in 2010.",

According to Jakob Hallgren, director of the Foreign Policy Institute, there is a great risk that a long period of disarmament will now stop – or reverse. - This is the first time since the early 1970s that there is no agreement regulating the number and use of the most powerful nuclear weapons between the two countries that have the most in the entire world, he says. Regulated the most dangerous weapons The agreement that is now expiring has been about limiting strategic nuclear weapons, above all intercontinental missiles that can be fired from the US at Russia - or vice versa. In recent decades, these agreements have led to a sharp reduction in the world's nuclear arsenals. - During these 50 years, they have gone from a maximum of 70,000 nuclear weapons down to 12,000 today. It is a result of successive reductions that are now stopping – or, in the worst case, reversing. According to Hallgren, the risks already exist today. One of the biggest problems is that the US and Russia can no longer agree on new agreements. Today, China is estimated to have around 600 nuclear weapons, but Hallgren points to information which claims that the country may be on its way to 1,000 or 1,500. - China is now the factor that makes it impossible to come to an agreement. The US has said it wants China on board, but the Chinese say no. Increased tensions - also in Europe When there is no agreement that regulates the most devastating nuclear weapons, tensions in the outside world also increase, says Hallgren. The expert emphasizes that even a limited use of nuclear weapons would have extreme consequences. - Even the smallest nuclear weapon would have completely devastating effects, with hundreds of thousands - if not millions - of people injured or killed. There are terrible effects of nuclear weapons. At the same time, there is still the so-called non-proliferation agreement, which came into force at the end of the 1960s and aims",

But the funding itself must still come from the countries' own, often already strained budgets. From Berlin to Dresden by high-speed train In the south of Berlin, a new railway line shines in the sun. Double tracks, high noise barriers and a nail-straight stretch to the south. It is Germany's newest high-speed line, which opened at the beginning of December 2025 and makes the journey between Berlin and Dresden ten minutes faster. The project took 20 years to plan and seven years to build – but without any delays. The next step is to extend the route to the Czech capital Prague. Then the travel time between Berlin and Prague will be reduced to two and a half hours, compared to almost five hours today. Such a project is exactly what the European Commission wants the member states to invest in. Underinvestment, cheap tickets and short-term thinking But according to Christian Böttger, it will take years before a similar project can be inaugurated in Germany – or in Europe as a whole. According to him, billions are missing to even renovate the existing railway. The funds that do exist are often used for short-term solutions or for politically popular measures, such as lowering the price of train tickets. In Germany, years of underinvestment are clearly visible. Only about 62 percent of the trains run on time. Sweden is average within the EU, but still manages better, with around 87 percent on time. - In such a situation, to believe that new high-speed lines will be built within 15 years is wishful thinking, he says.",

  "d39132ccb5849bd8b9e5720520d6590fbfc7245e": "Thursday evening and Friday can be messy in parts of Skåne. Previously, an orange warning for snowfall combined with wind has been issued for south-eastern Skåne, and in the southern and central parts of the county a yellow warning has been issued for similar weather conditions. The warnings apply from five o'clock on Thursday afternoon and extend until two o'clock on Friday afternoon. - In the south-eastern parts, there may be upwards of 20 centimeters of snow, locally more. There will also be a fresh to strong easterly wind - and then you know there will be snowdrifts in Österlen, says TV4 Nyhetern's meteorologist Peter Kondrup. \"Bare ground to half a meter of snow in no time\" Drift formation is a recurring problem in the open landscapes of Scania. Despite a snowfall of around 20 centimetres, the snow depth can vary significantly, which can affect both major and minor roads. - If you've ever been to Skåne, you know that it can go from bare ground to half a meter of snow in no time. There is nothing to stop the snow, but it drifts from one place to another and unfortunately often accumulates on the road. The advice is not to go out in traffic if you really don't have to, says Peter Kondrup. The last time there was an orange warning in approximately the same area in south-eastern Scania, a large part of the forecast was missed. - There were not as large quantities as feared and therefore there were not as many problems as had been expected. However, it remains to be seen how it will turn out this time – forecasts are forecasts, says Peter Kondrup. Risk of ice slippage Along the Öresund coast in the west, mild air will move in from the south, which can lead to freezing rain and ice slippage. - So it can be really noisy in Skåne tomorrow, with drifting snow in Österlen and risk of icy conditions in the west. In addition to Skåne, SMHI has issued a yellow warning for snowfall in parts of Halland and Västra Götaland counties. The warning applies from six o'clock on Friday morning and extends from just north of Varberg up to Trollhättan. During Friday, the weather moves north and in the West",

  "bb1fe796044e846e372c041cee147d3ccd82b4ec": "The National Board of Health and Welfare has gone through 98 cases where children and adults in the years 2019 to 2024 have been killed or subjected to serious violence. Among these there are 41 cases involving children and in half of those cases it is the child's own parent who exposed them to the violence. Is it a failure? - You have to say that. When we have gone through these 98 cases, they are cases that have fallen between society's safety nets and then suffered fatal violence, have been murdered or serious violence, says Björn Eriksson in Nyhetsmorgon. Difficult to put together the puzzle The survey adds to previous reports on intimate partner violence to identify where society is failing. - We know what the risk factors are. Often there has been contact with the health and medical services. The police have been aware of them and social services have been aware. But it has been difficult to piece together this complex picture as it has been. That is what has broken, says Björn Eriksson. The National Board of Health and Welfare points out that these are unusual, but very serious crimes. - The vast majority of parents do not harm their children and the vast majority of women are not killed by a partner. But every case is so serious. We have an obligation to better prevent, says Moa Mannheimer, licensed psychologist and investigator at the National Board of Health and Welfare. Must listen more to the children The authority has several proposals for measures that must be presented to the government. An important part is more collaboration. - We can see in retrospect that the police had certain duties, the social service had certain duties and the health care service others. But putting the puzzle together and assessing risks in a structured way - that has been missing in these cases, says Moa Mannheimer. Another measure identified is that the child's situation must be strengthened. - You need to listen more to the children's voice both within healthcare, the police and social services. We need to take steps forward and not always just listen to the parents' version, but also take in the whole, says Björn Eriksson.",

  "ac38a9d07d9b6a5d78a4425981f9df7e21faf9be": "A week and a half ago, Djurens vänner in Staffanstorp in Scania received an emergency call from a family who could no longer care for the 30 guinea pigs they had at the time. Actually, the animal shelter did not have room for more animals, but still chose to move in. - We still felt that the situation was so big. The family really needed help, says Linnéa Stålhandske, operational director of Friends of the Animals Skåne.  More guinea pigs than expected When the animal friends arrived at the family in Staffanstorp, they were greeted by more animals than expected – 40 guinea pigs and a turtle. Guinea pigs become fertile as early as three to four weeks of age, which means they can reproduce quickly if kept together.  - Then they often mate with those nearby. If it is then a mother or a sister, it will be inbreeding. To avoid further reproduction, all males have now been neutered. When the guinea pigs were taken into care, fur and claws were left behind. Among the guinea pigs was \"Grandma Rosiepuff\", the oldest guinea pig who is believed to be the mother of many of the others. - She is probably related to all of them. She is the oldest guinea pig we have received, says Linnéa Stålhandske in Nyhetsmorgon.  \"Looking for the perfect homes\" After the case drew attention in social media, the animal shelter has received many expressions of interest. At the same time, care is taken to only place the guinea pig with serious animal owners.  - We do not sell small animals to be kept in cages. We do not sell small animals to be toys for children, of course. So we look for the perfect homes.  Guinea pigs can live between five and ten years if cared for properly. They need large areas to move around, such as a paddock or their own room, and should never be kept alone. They require companionship, a proper diet of fresh vegetables and free access to hay.",

She makes bonnets, jewelery and art objects from reindeer antler, leather and wood for Jokkmokk's market. Despite the fact that e-commerce has grown in importance, the market is still the most important sales opportunity of the year for many Sami artisans. Combining crafts and reindeer herding Julia and many other Sami craftsmen combine crafting with reindeer herding. During the winter, spring and summer, reindeer husbandry takes up most of the time, while autumn is devoted to handicrafts. The work is long-term and already in the spring of the year before, planning begins for next year's market. - Yes, for me it is like that, at the market you sell for the whole year. After all, the market is the target, because it is precisely Sami craftsmanship that you want to see, look at and feel. So you prefer to buy on the spot, it's not something you just order. But you want to see what you get, says Julia Rensberg. Long-term planning for the future The materials, reindeer antler, hide and wood, for the craft often have to dry for one to two years in order not to crack and break during the crafting itself, which requires careful planning. Julia Rensberg emphasizes the importance of being careful with both materials and resources to secure the opportunities of future generations. - The material should ideally dry for one to two years, so this spring I started thinking about the market that will come in 2027. It takes time and you have to be careful both with materials and resources and think far ahead and also make sure that there is material left for future generations, says Julia Rensberg.",

Police in Arizona suspect she has been abducted from her home outside of Tucson and are investigating the incident as a crime. Nancy Guthrie was last seen late Saturday night, January 31, when she returned home to her residence. When she didn't show up at church the following morning, friends and family raised the alarm, and she was reported missing at lunchtime on Sunday. Demanding ransom US media have reported signs of a break-in and traces of blood in the home. However, authorities have been tight-lipped on details and have not publicly confirmed exactly what was found, citing the ongoing investigation. The incident has gained further attention after several media outlets, including TMZ, reported receiving messages demanding a ransom for Nancy Guthrie's release.  The police have not yet confirmed that the claims come from an actual perpetrator – but have not dismissed them either. \"When messages come to us, we treat it like any evidence,\" Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told CBS News. The family's plea Four days after the disappearance, Savannah Guthrie, along with her siblings, posted a video on Instagram in which they directly address the person who may be holding their mother captive. - We are ready to talk. But we live in a world where voices and images can be easily manipulated. We have to be absolutely sure she's alive. And that you have her. We want to hear from you, and we are ready to listen, she says.  She also tells us that her mother lives with constant pain and depends on her medicine to survive.  - Everyone is looking for you, mother, everywhere. We will not rest. Your children will not rest until we are together again, she says.

The government believes that this has led to people convicted of rape in some cases having to stay in Sweden. The government wants rape and other serious sexual crimes to always be considered extremely serious crimes when considering deportation. - Rapists must be able to be deported. It doesn't get any weirder than that, says Migration Minister Johan Forssell (M) to TV4 Nyheterna. Wants to get other countries on board According to Forssell, Sweden is the first to come out with the initiative, but the government hopes to get other countries on board, mainly within the EU and the Nordics. The work is now starting at the UN level and the process may be long, even if movement is hoped for already this year. - Sweden will soon have the toughest regulations in the Nordics for criminal deportations, but it is not enough. We also want to change the international framework, says Forssell. In parallel, the government is expected to present new Swedish legislation this spring, which could lead to more criminal deportations. The individual examination in court must remain, but the government wants rape to always weigh very heavily in the assessment. Dismisses symbolic politics The background is that Swedish courts, with reference to current practice and international conventions, in some cases judged that the crime was not serious enough for deportation. The government therefore wants to influence how the refugee convention is applied, including through changes in UNHCR's governing documents. Forssell dismisses the initiative as symbolic politics, but admits that the process can be both difficult and time-consuming. - This is work that has not been touched on for a very long time, he says.",

This is shown in a research report from AgriFood Economics, which is a collaboration between the Swedish University of Agriculture and Lund University. If the dietary change persists, it can make us sicker. \n\n- The fact that we reduce the intake of fruit and vegetables and also dietary fibre, has had a negative effect on public health. Above all, cardiovascular diseases could increase if we continued to eat this way over time, says Jonas Nordström, who is associate professor of economics and one of the report's authors.  Does not buy fresh fish Eva Ahlgren from Malmö shops with her husband and grandchildren at Ica Mathuset in Åkarp, Scania. She notes that they never bought very much fruit and vegetables, because the husband is not that fond of vegetables, but they buy less fish today than before the price increases.\n\n- Maybe frozen fish in that case. Fresh is very expensive, she says. \n\nLars Håhus, who is a regular customer in the store, belongs to those who have not changed their purchasing habits at all in recent years.\n\n- I'm as stingy as I've always been and buy what I want and what's the best price, he says with a smile.  Hitting low-income earners Jonas Nordström and his research colleagues at AgriFood Economics could also see that it was the cheapest goods that received the highest percentage price increases. A phenomenon known as \"cheapflation\".\n\n- It is often households with fairly small margins who choose the cheap products. In this way, it can be said that cheapflation and the inflation we have had have affected low-income households to a greater extent, notes Jonas Nordström.

This also applies to parts of the plot that belong to Bengt's hotel. - I thought: What on earth? It wasn't destroyed yesterday, but it happened this morning. I've never seen anything like it. - And it continues to blow. So it's great weather. Bengt Lundblad and the family also celebrated his 74th birthday at the same place. - Then we had sunshine and there were sunbeds and laps of sun. So there are tremendous contrasts. \"People stay inside\" When asked what the atmosphere is like in the village, the birthday boy replies that he doesn't know. - There aren't that many people out, so we don't meet that many. They stay inside, people down here. After all, they also warned us - we shouldn't go out, they said. But Bengt Lundblad does not feel particularly worried about himself. - We have a good hotel that stands firm, he says and continues: - You have to stay away from the sea. Now we are actually sitting in a restaurant by the sea. But it's on solid ground so it won't fall down. On Friday, the storm will subside and Bengt Lundblad and his family will remain in Calahonda next week as well. - So we hope for a few sunny days.",

The talks were confirmed by both sides late Wednesday after some uncertainty about the time and place. Focus on the nuclear program The US delegation wants to investigate \"zero nuclear weapons capability\" for Iran, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, who emphasizes that Trump has \"many options at his disposal beyond diplomacy\", reports AFP. The talks come shortly after widespread protests in Iran, where human rights groups report tens of thousands dead after heavy crackdowns.\n\n- They are negotiating, Trump says of Iran.\n\n- They don't want us to attack them, we have a large fleet heading there, he adds, referring to the group of aircraft carriers he called an \"armada\".\n\nVice President JD Vance says Trump \"will talk to everybody, he will try to accomplish what he can through non-military means and if he feels the military is the only option, he will ultimately choose it.\" Regional concerns and diplomatic hopes German Chancellor Friedrich Merz calls on Iran's leadership to \"really start talks\" and warns of \"great fear of military escalation in the region\". Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says that \"the parties want to give room for diplomacy\" and that conflict \"was not the solution\".\n\nAccording to the New York Times, the US has agreed to exclude regional actors from the talks, but missile and militia issues can still be discussed.  The Institute for the Study of War states that \"Iran continues to show inflexibility in meeting US demands, reducing the likelihood that Iran and the US will be able to reach a diplomatic solution\".\n\nIran has warned to strike back against US bases if attacked. \n\n- We are ready to defend ourselves and it is the President of the United States who must choose between compromise or war, said General Mohammad Akraminia.",

  "929f7723a7490779b6801a57d839f22b8a0f66d7": "It was a couple of years ago that Dumpen confronted a man who they believed had sex-chatted with a 14-year-old. After being hanged, the man stated that he felt unwell and was unable to work, which led him to sue Dumpen's responsible publisher for gross defamation. - This one is perhaps particularly interesting because Dumpen is very much noticed in society. It poses very big questions at its tip that arouse a lot of emotions, says Ängla Pändel, lawyer and expert on defamation issues. \"Quite unique for Sweden\" According to a jury, which is used in this type of case, she is guilty. But now the judge must also take a position on the issue and announce the verdict today. In this case, Dumpen can be convicted of defamation regardless of whether the man was guilty of the sex chats or not. - It is quite unique for Sweden that the defamation provision also covers information that is true. But on the other hand, you carry out a type of justifiability assessment, so in some cases it can still be justifiable to spread this type of information if you can show that the public interest outweighs the individual's right to privacy and protection of personal integrity, explains Ängla Pändel.",

He has also served as secretary general of the Council of Europe and as chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee.  Now Norway's ecocrime authority has decided to investigate him, following suspicions that he was guilty of ecocrime in his contacts with Jeffrey Epstein. - We have decided to start an investigation against Thorbjørn Jagland, says Pål K. Lønseth, head of the Norwegian Ecocrime Authority, to NRK. More specifically, they are investigating whether Jagland received gifts, trips and loans while he was chairman of the Nobel Committee and secretary general of the Council of Europe. Want to waive immunity There is, however, an aggravating circumstance. Jagland has immunity for his former role in the Council of Europe. The ecocrime authority now wants the Norwegian Foreign Ministry to lift that immunity, reports Dagbladet. \"Because Jagland has immunity as the former head of an international organization, Ekokrim has asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to take the initiative to lift the immunity,\" the authority writes in a press release. Norway's Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide agrees with the Ecocrime Authority that Jagland's immunity must be lifted. - It is important that this issue is clarified. Then Jagland's immunity cannot stand in the way of an investigation. I have therefore decided that Norway should present a proposal to the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers that Jagland's immunity should be lifted, says the foreign minister. Taking the investigation in stride Thorbjørn Jagland's defense lawyer, Anders Brosveet, however, takes the accusations against his client in stride. He tells VG that they will cooperate with the investigation and submit the requested documentation. - And based on what we have found, we are calmly looking at the outcome. It is first and foremost good for Jagland to get an authoritative clarification from Ekokrim, rather than the entire press corps carrying out its own little private investigation, says Brosveet.  Emails in the latest Epstein files show, among other things",

  "720d18b9711156d13bfeba8e583fd3d856114b87": "According to an American study, one in four singles in the United States, and almost half of Generation Z, use AI to, among other things, analyze messages when dating online. One of those who use AI as a springboard in their dating is Dilara Chakali. - When I went to therapy, I felt: One hour a week was not enough for me. I wanted to reflect more. I wanted to understand myself more, how I function in dating, says Dilara Chakali in Efter fem. \"Not so strange\" Dilara Chakali says that she uses AI to get straight answers, but emphasizes that it is she herself who decides which advice she takes to heart. - I want \"the ugly truth\", she says.  - Then of course I choose how I act on it. I want to believe that I have the self-awareness that I don't act on everything it says, she says. Psychologist Maria Farm believes that it is a natural human behavior to ask for advice. And in this way, it is understandable that more and more people are using AI in these matters. - I think it is a natural consequence. That it is there and that we also use it in psychological matters, I don't think that is so strange in itself, says Maria Farm in Efter fem. The psychologist's advice: See it as a supplement Farm sees no major problems with using AI as support, but urges you to ask yourself the question for what purpose you are asking a question, as it can become destructive in the long run if you constantly have to ask and cannot make decisions yourself. - I have many clients who are a bit anxious, full of anxiety and they sometimes need to practice not actually asking so many questions about it, it could be the relationship, but it could also be their own health.  - With me, they get to practice standing up for their own opinion or maybe not asking for completely certain answers all the time, adds Farm. Maria Farm recommends that AI be used as part of a larger palette when it comes to big decisions in life. - If you are thinking about something as big as divorce, also ask a person. It doesn't have to be a therapist, but some wise person you trust",

  "a9cff08032cb77552a536a8a010fcb00023732c4": "Since the middle of January, a high pressure has settled over Sweden. Especially high pressure and freezing temperatures go hand in hand during the winter months, not least when it becomes prolonged.  In meteorology, such a locked-in high pressure is called a high-pressure blockage, and is what lays the foundation for weather extremes. - Blocking high pressure creates winter's cold snaps and summer's heat waves, explains TV4 meteorologist Ulrika Elvgren. Therefore the cold remains The reason why the high pressure has become permanent is partly that it consists of slowly sinking air, that is to say that it receives its air supply from above. The cold air is also heavier than the warm, and air accumulation (high pressure) therefore thrives in the atmosphere closest to the ground. In order to break the high-pressure bucket, an extensive low pressure with a substantial portion of mild air is therefore required.  But during periods of high pressure blocking, the low pressure is instead guided around the high pressure and the cold, as now, is allowed to remain undisturbed.  - It's a locked-in weather situation and we've had this high pressure now for several weeks, but it might start to weaken a little during the next week and let in a little more weakened frontal zones, says Ulrika Elvgren. - We have already received a little more snow in southern Sweden. But it looks like the cold air won't let go. A cold domain lies over the whole of northern Europe and into the Russian continent and further east, she adds. \"No clear mild air coming in\" Although the high pressure may change at the beginning of next week, one should not count on the cold air to disappear because of it. Further ahead, the forecasts are too uncertain to be able to draw any conclusions. - It looks like colder air will return as we approach the middle of February. We have no clear mild air coming in. Maybe sometime in the second half, towards the end of February. But the first half of February still looks very cold, says Ulrika Elvgren. - There is no hope of any spring heat before Valentine's Day. From February 15 starts",

The Jas Gripen is a far better and more cost-effective alternative, it is believed.  The proposal by Saab to sell the Jas Gripen to Canada should be adopted immediately, Opposition Leader Davies said at a press briefing in the Canadian Parliament in Ottawa last night, underlining that the situation is serious. Reduced dependence on the United States The play is done against the background of Canada's decision to expand its air combat forces with 88 new planes. 16 of these, F-35 Lightning from American Lockheed Martin are already booked and ordered. But there is now an intense debate about the remaining 72 combat aircraft; which plan to choose? Concerns about the reliability of the United States as a partner have grown in Canada following Donald Trump's repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state of the United States. The opposition now also points out that Prime Minister Mark Carney himself in his famous speech in Davos recently emphasized that Canada must act more independently and reduce its dependence on the United States and invest more in cooperation with medium-sized countries. \n\n- If Mark Carney completes the purchase of the F-35, it proves that his statements in Davos were just a PR stunt, says Don Davies.

We would see it as a hub for exports, said Mikael Franzén, head of marketing for Saab's Gripen program at the Singapore Airshow yesterday.

In connection with the visit, Åkesson had planned to participate in the traditional reindeer race, but the SD leader needed to think again. According to information to TV4 Nyheterna, Åkesson skips the competition at the request of Säpo. \"Heard it was a revolver\" Several politicians on site have been informed of an \"incident\" by the authority. The party leader tells TV4 Nyheterna that he learned that someone dropped a weapon-like object near him. - I heard that it was a revolver or a pistol, says Jimmie Åkesson. The police write on their website that they have information about a weapon-like object, but that it must have been picked up and that one or more people must have left the scene. The police have not yet found any weapon. At first there were reports that politicians had been threatened, but the police deny this. Säpo denies Säpo's press service does not want to go into whether they warned the SD leader about a firearm. - Our dialogue with our guardians is not something we can go into, so I cannot say anything about it. It is part of the protection itself, says Säpo's spokesperson Johan Wikström. The Sweden Democrats' press department cannot confirm whether Åkesson has received threats. - The information I have is that he is not running, and it is after a recommendation from Säpo, says party spokesperson Emma Kareld. It is not the first time Jimmie Åkesson has had to leave Jokkmokk's market. In 2014, his book signing at the market was stopped due to threats, which SVT Norrbotten reported on at the time.",

Both features are made with reporter Filip Jacobsson. - It is an honor, but it is Filip who should have the credit for the idea for the feature, says Petter Åkerman. Celebrating the aesthetic quality Daniel Zdolsek also highlights reporter Filip Jacobsson. - The fact that we are nominated says something about the fact that we have reporters who care about the aesthetic expression and quality, and that we have been seen so much in recent years. It says something about where the channel stands in terms of quality compared to the competitors - I think we are far ahead of everyone else. It's fun, says Daniel Zdolsek and adds: - TV4 allows you to develop and express yourself aesthetically and visually qualitatively during the work shifts, which I value.",

It comes below the inflation target of two percent, says Frida Bratt.

At the same time, it may take some time before a possible reduction takes place. - Even if the next step could be a reduction, it could take a while.

Pressure against Iran to increase At the same time, Sweden wants to see continued heavy international pressure against the Iranian regime. The government supports new EU sanctions against regime representatives who were involved in the deadly violence against protesters.  Sweden also welcomes that the EU countries have now agreed to list the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as terrorists - a demand that the government has pushed for for a long time with the support of a unanimous Riksdag. - No one can do everything, but everyone can do something. We are at the forefront now in Europe and hope that more countries will follow with similar support, says Dousa.\n\nThe government's announcement comes at the same time as the protests in Iran continue to be met with harsh reprisals from the regime.

Such as whether it is still possible to trust the USA, or possibly it is time for Sweden to build up its own nuclear deterrent. - Not to show the power like the USA, that we have this, and sort of show the shoulders and muscles. But as a defense for a country that has fought for so many years to become the strong Sweden that it is right now, says Marya Osman. - That can be an argument, but at the same time we have allies who have nuclear weapons. So nuclear weapons should deter, and it won't if everyone has them, says Roger Wilhelmsson. Higher support than expected In a survey conducted by Novus with 1,007 respondents, 68 percent recently said no to Sweden acquiring its own nuclear weapons to increase its security. But 17 per cent positive was still higher support than expected, according to the head of research for the FOI's nuclear analysis programme. - People's concerns are expressed in this, and it's not entirely unreasonable. That doesn't mean the doors to everyone are open to anything right now, so to speak. But it is probably a reflection of the fact that we have a challenging security policy situation where people are willing to reconsider previous positions, says Karl Sörenson, head of FOI research. At the same time, new nuclear weapons programs have a high price. According to Sörenson, Europe should primarily deepen cooperation with France's and Great Britain's already existing programs, but primarily continue to build up its conventional defense capabilities. Difficult situation for the USA Sörenson also points out that, despite Trump's actions, the USA continues to guarantee NATO's nuclear deterrent, and preferably does not want to see a too strong Europe there. - The spread effect that would then occur might not only be in Europe but contagion and spread further in the world, it would create a situation that is much more complicated even for the United States to handle, if many countries in the world acquire nuclear weapons. So for the US it is probably in many ways better to have it that way",

During Friday, charges were brought against an activist in the group, suspected of illegal threats and grossly illegal threats. The man denies any wrongdoing.\n\nMunicipal politician Showan Shattak in Malmö has expressed support for the action, which has led to criticism within the Left Party.

Sharp criticism of the party leader Civil Defense Minister Carl-Oskar Bohlin (M) calls Dadgostar's answer \"completely substandard\" and writes on X that she came up with an \"obvious lie\".\n\nWhen Dadgostar left the meeting at the Government Office, TV4 Nyheterna tried to get a comment about the conflict, but she got into one of Säpo's cars and left the scene without answering. \"We have to go on,\" said one of the party's employees, as Dadgostar left the scene.\n\nAfterwards, TV4 Nyheterna sent written questions to the Left Party. The party's press office replies: \"In our party, the party secretary and party districts are responsible for internal dialogue. Beyond that, we have no further comment at this time.\" \"Hiding from the media\" Bohlin continues to direct sharp criticism at Dadgostar: - You can easily get the impression that Nooshi Dadgostar is hiding from the media in this matter and that's enough, but what she is mainly hiding from are large parts of her own party, Bohlin tells TV4 Nyheterna. - Her party association in Sweden's third largest city supports threats and actions against ministers in the government.

In total, there are now close to 30 former patients who have sounded the alarm. Today, some of the women who participated in Kalla fakta's report Barnmakarna were invited to a meeting with Minister of Health Elisabet Lann. - I was incredibly deeply moved by their story. It has played a role that they tell and dare to step forward, says Lann. Unscientific treatment methods Cold facts have revealed, among other things, that Eliva sold unscientific treatment methods and failed to report medical injuries to Lex Maria.  Eliva believes that all their treatments are medically justified, and that no patient has been harmed at their clinic. But today the former patients had to give their picture to the minister. - It felt like she was listening. Our goal is that no woman should have to go through what we did and we really believe that the meeting will have an effect, says one of them, Iris. A health care scandal Health Minister Elisabet Lann calls what happened at Eliva a major health care scandal and during the meeting took up two measures to prevent it from happening again: Firstly, it should be easier for patients to determine which treatment methods are approved by offering them knowledge support. It is a question that is now on the Board of Health and Welfare's table. Elisabet Lann further believes that Kalla fakta's disclosure has also brought up the issue of licensing requirements for private healthcare companies. An investigation into this is ongoing. - This would mean that everyone who is currently a care provider would have to be approved in order to get this permit. It is a way to get rid of unscrupulous actors, she believes. Elisabet Lann reacts strongly to the fact that Eliva has not made a single patient-related Lex Maria report in five years despite repeated serious incidents and care injuries at the clinic. She directs criticism at the supervisory authority IVO - They should do their job and not settle for records that are deficient, but there is obviously documentation here that should",

Several politicians in the municipal board supported the proposal and hope that the initiative will lead to both better health and more residents. But Suzann Larsdotter sees both opportunities and risks. Voluntariness and integrity in focus According to Larsdotter, it can be positive to raise questions about sexual health and intimacy, especially since many couples find it difficult to find time for closeness in everyday life. - In my clinical everyday life, many people find it difficult to find time, so maybe this could make it easier, she says in Efter fem. At the same time, she warns that political initiatives in the area risk becoming normative and putting pressure on residents to have children. - It can become a bit problematic when the municipality somewhere puts pronatalist pressure on the population and somehow urges that it is an obligation to have children, says Suzann Larsdotter. \"A way to get some attention\" Larsdotter believes that the proposal is primarily a way to create debate and visibility ahead of the upcoming election year. - I think this was a way to get some attention to politics. They got quite a lot of media attention through this proposal, she says. She also points out that there are practical and ethical issues to consider, and that employers must protect the privacy of their employees. - It should be about privacy and maybe it shouldn't be personnel policy at work, says Suzann Larsdotter.",

According to information to TV4 Nyheterna, the authority is suspected of covering up nearly 200 possible environmental crimes by not reporting the incidents to the police. The majority of cases are linked to LKAB, SSAB and Boliden Mineral. TV4 Nyheterna has now spoken to employees at the County Administrative Board in Norrbotten. - We have long been very frustrated about this very thing, that you don't file a police report when it comes to environmental crimes. There are several of us who are very critical of how the County Administrative Board handles suspected environmental crimes, says a person at the authority. The suspicions of malfeasance at the County Administrative Board came to light when the police received a report about one of Sweden's largest diesel spills - just over three years after it occurred. In connection with that investigation, the police discovered another 200 unreported suspected environmental crimes. - It should be enough that the County Administrative Board has a suspicion of environmental crime, then a report must be made. Then the police can investigate whether it is or not. We should not sit at the County Board and investigate whether it might be an environmental crime or not. And it takes a long time. In some cases the police report is not submitted, in other cases it has taken two or three years to submit a police report, says an employee to TV4 Nyheterna. \"Nothing happens\" Several people with insight tell TV4 Nyheterna that the County Administrative Board's long delay in reporting suspected environmental crimes, when it is reported, among other things complicates the police's preliminary investigation and that the police are then several years behind in the investigation. - Partly that. But even then, these activities that caused the environmental crime are allowed to continue and continue to pollute or whatever it is they are doing. In that way, the County Administrative Board becomes complicit in making things worse, says an informant at the authority. It is managers at the authority who must report possible environmental crimes etc",

This was stated by the Federal Customs Service on Thursday. The gray space rock, which weighs over 2.5 tons, was discovered during a routine inspection of a sea container in the port of St. Petersburg.  In the export documents, the cargo was described as a garden sculpture, but when customs officials took a closer look, it quickly became clear that something was not right - neither with the object's origin nor its true value. Cargo worth SEK 38 million The fragment is believed to come from the world-famous Aletai meteorite, one of the largest known iron meteorites on Earth.  In a video released by the authorities, customs personnel can be seen breaking open a wooden box and exposing the massive stone, with a rough, gray and uneven surface. According to Russian customs authorities, the meteorite fragment could be worth around 323 million rubles – equivalent to almost 38 million kroner. 4.5 billion years old Who is behind the smuggling attempt has not been made public, but authorities confirm that the destination was Britain. A criminal investigation has now been opened by prosecutors. The Aletai meteorite was discovered in western China back in 1898 and is estimated to be at least 4.5 billion years old – almost as old as the solar system itself.

The aircraft began to accelerate, reaching about 200 kilometers per hour, according to FlightRadar.  Suddenly the pilots realized they were on the taxiway, the road used to get out to the runway. They were forced to cross, veered left and ended up in the grass. - It is very serious, says aviation expert and former SAS pilot Björn Lundström. He believes that it could have been much, much worse. - A car could have come out on this taxiway or another plane or other traffic, he says and adds: - Then they would have had a collision. Deadly examples In commercial traffic, it is very rare for aircraft to take off from the taxiway. But there are examples. Last year, a Boeing 737-800 was aborted from takeoff after air traffic control at Orlando airport discovered they were on the taxiway.  Björn Lundström also raises a tragic example from 2000. At the airport in Singapore, a passenger plane bound for Los Angeles began to take off from a closed runway.  The plane collided with construction machinery and equipment and 83 people died.  Swedes on board Several KD politicians were on the plane.  - As I understand it, it would have been difficult to stop the plane if we had driven five more seconds, says Dan-Ove Marcelind (KD) to Expressen. According to him, the staff was stressed because the flight was heavily delayed.  - Stress is a risk factor for a pilot, you know that, so you should be extra vigilant, says Björn Lundström. He is surprised by the incident. The taxiway is marked with completely different lighting and signs compared to the runways.  Björn Lundström also says that the aircraft probably had a map in the cockpit with the exact position.

The suspected abuses took place between 2009 and 2013, and at the end of May last year, over 160 former students at the school where the teacher worked received letters from the police stating that they are plaintiffs in the investigation.  Now the Södertörn district court announces that the prosecution will not be tried, because the teacher was convicted in 2023 by the Svea Court of Appeal for several cases of child pornography crimes. The penalty was three years and six months in prison - a sentence he is still serving. - The films in this case were included in the previous indictment, but the plaintiffs were then unidentified. If the prosecutor had wanted to test how it happened when the films were recorded, this would have been investigated before charges were brought for the possession of the films, says councilor Fredrik Nydén, who was the court's chairman.  The district court has also ruled that the surreptitious filming, which the man admitted, does not fall under the criminal classification of sexual harassment, which was required for the plaintiff to receive damages. This means that all claims for damages have been rejected. \"Hard to find words\" Hanna Charlton is one of the 50 affected girls. She is 22 years old today. - That the verdict resulted in zero extended sentence and zero kroner in compensation to the victims is completely unimaginable to me, given what he has actually done to us over so many years. I have difficulty finding words for this, she says to TV4 Nyheterna. Although the legal process is aimed at the individual man and the crimes he committed, Hanna thinks that other actors also have a great responsibility in this.

She believes that Dumpen has worked for several years to bring about a change in the law.  - In the midst of all this, we have children who feel terribly bad, who harm themselves and who cannot be rehabilitated. That's how tragic it can be. We're talking about children who can't protect themselves, that's where we adults need to intervene, not grown men who feel violated, she says. The man: Feeling very bad It was a couple of years ago that Dumpen confronted the man, who the site claimed had sex-chatted with a 14-year-old. The man was then publicly hanged and the post was widely circulated. After the publication, the man stated that he felt very unwell and was unable to work.

She must also pay SEK 43,100 in damages to the man. \"Sweden forgets the children\" Sara Nilsson is critical of the man now being awarded damages. - The Swedish state is probably quite alone in providing these gentlemen with money so that they can buy new hardware so that they can continue to look for children online, she says and continues: - It is sadness and frustration.

But now the trend has turned.  The number of confirmed cases and patients in intensive care is increasing. - We'll see if it's just a temporary bump in the curve and it goes down in the future or if there will be an increase again, says Magnus Gisslén. Klara Sondén, deputy state epidemiologist at the Public Health Agency says that the rise is quite expected after the Christmas holidays. - We are all on site in schools and workplaces. You have many contacts, so it is easy for the infection to spread from person to person. The Public Health Agency predicts that the spread of influenza will continue in the coming months.  It is the new aggressive mutation H3N2 that dominates the spread of infection right now.   - It can escape our immune system a little easier than other variants precisely because it has changed so much. The effect of vaccines is also slightly worse on this variant. Winter sickness on the rise As far as winter sickness is concerned, the peak has not been reached. The spread of infection is on the rise and the number of confirmed cases at the Public Health Agency is higher compared to the same period last year.  Everything indicates that the spread of infection continues to increase, it will take some time before the curves start to turn downwards. - You can count on it to increase now for a number of weeks until March, says Magnus Gisslén. The Swedish Public Health Agency urges you to wash your hands thoroughly and stay home if you are sick.  If you have symptoms of a respiratory infection, remember to show special consideration to the people who are at risk of becoming seriously ill. This applies even if your symptoms are mild.",

The band was supposed to ride a fire pole down on stage, but because they had much heavier equipment than you normally have as a firefighter, Olle injured his hand.  - There are things that happen, but he is not allowed to ride the pole on Saturday, says band member Glenn Borgkvist to TV4 Nyheterna.  Olle Östberg was forced to sew four stitches and Brandsta had to redo the number. Among other things, they are introducing a \"Brandsta dunk\" instead of the classic \"Brandsta clap\".  - He's not allowed to pole now, but that's what happens - you have to improvise a bit. We'll work it out, but he'll be damned if we have to cast his whole hand.  Haven't been in Mello for 23 years Brandta City Släckers haven't competed in Melodifestivalen since 2003 and thus become one of the year's biggest comebacks to the competition.  - It's crazy fun, completely crazy but great fun. It could be that we weren't interesting anymore, but we've gotten a lot of attention so it's great fun. We are tagged, says Glenn Borgkvist.  Together with band members Mats Nilsson, Ulf Johansson and Tom Börjesson, Olle and Glenn perform the song \"Rakt in i elden\" in Melodifestivalen's second competition.  - It's a song with a lot of joy, it's \"smoke n' roll 2.0\", but it sounds like 2026 and it should, says Glenn Borgkvist to TV4 Nyheterna.",

The Reaggeton artist was the most streamed artist on Spotify last year and is an outspoken Trump critic.  During the performance, several famous artists appeared, including Lady Gaga and Ricky Martin. In addition to performing his most famous songs from the album \"Debí tirar mas fotos\", Bad Bunny finished by listing a number of countries from Central and South America and saying \"god bless america\".  He also carried an American football with the text \"Together we are America\". In the background, the text \"The only thing more powerful than hate is love\" appeared on the big screen.

  "c8deb7947e8201f0f91891d22738e5156006b3c9": "The fact that you lose income by babbling is perhaps not so strange. Money from Försäkringskassan covers just under 80 percent of the salary and there is also a cap on how much money you can get. But for the vast majority of people, vaping does not have a very large impact on the future pension, according to the Pensions Authority, which believes that it is sometimes presented as vaping can be a big sink. Vabb affects the pension to a very small extent. The allowance from Försäkringskassan is pensionable, although it may be slightly lower than the salary. In addition, the employer usually continues to pay into the occupational pension, which is therefore not affected, says Monica Zettervall at the Swedish Pensions Agency. Part-time a criminal According to the authority, it is a matter of relatively few kroner a month in reduced pension calculated over an entire working life. The pension system has built-in airbags which mean that parenthood affects the pension very little, says Monica Zettervall. What rather affects the pension is, among other things, how one chooses to share the parental allowance and the unpaid work in the home, for which women take responsibility to a greater extent. Part-time work is a factor that affects the long term. If you work part-time for more than four years when the children are small, it can start to be felt in the pension. During the first four years, there is pension entitlement for childhood years in the general pension system, which largely compensates for the loss of income.  Small difference Generally, high income earners in the private sector are affected more than those with low and medium incomes in the state and municipality, according to Zettervall.  The call from the Swedish Pensions Authority is not to worry too much about the pension when you are at home with a sick child. Most people who open their orange envelope won't see much of a difference because you've vacillated. I think it creates a lot of unnecessary anxiety, says Monica Zettervall.",

During the latest party leader debate, KD leader Ebba Busch attacked Magdalena Andersson (S) on the issue of maternity care and women's health. - If you compare the social democratic efforts during the whole eight years, they still do not reach what has been achieved during the last three years, said Ebba Busch, among other things. Tidöpartierna invests on a national level One of the crown jewels of Tidöpartierna's investments is a national plan for pregnancy, childbirth and aftercare. Recently, the government issued a press release stating that it is now making a \"major investment\" in maternity care and women's health. Among other things, it concerns targeted government support to the regions of around SEK 1 billion. But in previous years, the corresponding money bag in the state budget has been around SEK 1.6 billion. Health Minister Elisabet Lann points out that the government is putting money into a number of areas related to women's health, in addition to maternity care. - We are allocating SEK 200 million to care for victims of sexual violence. We are also putting half a billion extra into cancer healthcare, where breast cancer is the most common form of cancer. It is also great means of shortening the queues for prolapse operations. It is something that only women demand and need, she says. S criticizes the government for fiddling with numbers But the Social Democrats in the Stockholm region are now storming against the government's measures - which they consider to be fiddling with numbers. - The Swedish healthcare system has gone through a national healthcare crisis with great notice around the country. We know that it is the healthcare staff who are the most important resource in healthcare in order for us to shorten care queues and provide care as needed. The government must also see that, says Aida Hadzialic (S), regional councilor in Stockholm. - The entire Swedish healthcare system needs more resources. Our operating rooms, our medical centers",

Just over two weeks later, it announced to German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius that Germany will help Ukraine develop drones that can strike targets deep inside Russia. Now the plans are about to be realized - at least in Germany. This is stated by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a post on X. \"As early as mid-February, our drones will be produced in Germany,\" says Zelenskyy. Opening export centers in the Nordic countries The venture in Germany is one of several similar production lines in Europe, the president states. In the UK, production is said to be already underway. In addition to arms production, Ukraine will open a total of ten export centers in the Nordic and Baltic countries during the year. It is not clear exactly which countries are covered, but the Reuters news agency has previously reported that similar centers have been opened in both Copenhagen and Berlin in order to export the surplus from the joint production of weapons. - This is about co-production and export of the weapons that we can allow ourselves to sell in order to bring in more money for our own production of things that we lack and do not have money for, Zelenskyy told Reuters. Explosive increase in drones Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost four years ago, the country's investment in the defense industry in general – and drone production in particular – has increased explosively. In another post on X, Volodymyr Zelenskyj states that Ukraine now has 450 different producers of drones, of which 50 are world class. Together, they make up the largest industry currently operating in the country, according to the president. \"Aviation is one of the promising investment areas in Ukraine. Everyone wants to invest,\" says Zelenskyy. Production is not Ukraine's only success on the drone front. Recently, Elon Musk's space company SpaceX announced that it was shutting down",

You also need to learn to show respect for that, says Anna Brolin.

  "03d5cad54cc679077f9a7f9e74d7de73aaac5dd8": "Since the start of this year's ski season, more than 50 people have died in avalanche accidents in the Alps, according to the European Avalanche Warning Services (EAWS). Last Saturday, four people died in two separate avalanche accidents in Italy. The reason behind the fatal accidents can be several, and the snow-poor winter that prevails in large parts of the Alps is likely one of them. Less snow means that the snow is less compacted, and in addition weak layers of snow can remain for several weeks. - They are difficult for the common man to follow - and also for professionals, says Petter Palmgren, avalanche expert at the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency. A catalyst for accidents In addition to weather, a large proportion of accidents can be explained by the human factor. The majority of avalanches that occur are triggered naturally, but the avalanches that lead to deaths are almost exclusively triggered by humans, says Petter Palmgren. Statistically, accidents increase the more people are in the ski systems, and therefore the combination of newly fallen snow and snow-poor winters is a bit of a catalyst for accidents. - When a little snow finally falls, many people are starved for good skiing. Large avalanches are then quite common. Until the beginning of February in the previous two seasons, a total of 28 and 30 people respectively lost their lives in avalanche accidents in the Alps, according to figures from EAWS. This year, there have thus been almost twice as many fatal accidents within the same time period. - It's probably quite a lot for the time of year, says Petter Palmgren. \"It's not a good idea to go off-piste\" According to Petter Palmgren, off-piste skiers, top tourers and to some extent climbers are responsible for almost all avalanche-related deaths. Especially off-piste skating is popular among Swedes, and the sports holiday is just around the corner. - It is time to be extra careful if you go off-piste or go on a trip in the Alps during the sports holiday. These are risky activities that require preparation. Read up on the weather conditions and forecasts, and think about what you can and can't handle. It can go very quickly from feeling undramatic to a",

  "ab207eda691bfea1d776f4767fb1c5b8c0900466": "Far-right graffiti in Stockholm's schools has increased by 140 percent in the past three years, according to Stockholm city statistics reported by P4 Stockholm. At Skarpnäck's elementary school, racist stickers and swastikas have been discovered. The school management has urged parents to talk to their children about what happened. According to Christer Mattsson, researcher and expert on right-wing extremism and violence at the University of Gothenburg, the increase is neither unique to Stockholm nor a new phenomenon. - The behavior with doodles is something that goes in waves, he says. \"Generates a curiosity\" He links the development to the attention that has been around new far-right groups in recent years. - I would interpret it as being related to the attention that has been around new extreme right-wing groups, not least the active clubs, which in turn generate a curiosity and then you move that aesthetic out to the outside world. Similar graffiti waves have been seen before in Sweden, according to Mattsson. He points to the 1960s and the so-called squint epidemic. - The first wave was named the swastika epidemic where swastikas start to be scribbled everywhere and actually led to the first school effort in Sweden to raise awareness about the Holocaust. Today, doodling is not always about clear swastikas. Instead, more subtle symbols and number combinations are often used. - In a subculture, you would like to have symbols that you in that culture understand, but which are more difficult to understand for others. It creates a sense of belonging. Nazi memes An example is the number 14. - It is from an old Nazi slogan, it becomes 14 words, and this has been around for a long time. It is something that recurs and is reproduced in different contexts. At the same time, Mattsson believes that graffiti in a school environment is often connected to a wider exposure, above all digitally. - What is much more constant and at a much higher level, are the memes that appear on social media. Then you take the step Facing the messages repeatedly can have consequences, both for them",

Early on, investigators had both DNA and witness information about a woman in a black jacket and pink sweatpants, but despite extensive efforts, the killer went free for almost two decades. - One week, then it's solved, they said. A week passed, then two weeks passed, then a month passed, then three months passed, then six months passed, then a year, says Marie's sister Birgitta Borén in The Murder of Marie - that's why the killer goes free on TV4 PLAY The DNA finding was decisive The police were convinced for a long time that the case would be solved quickly. The coroner found clear repulsive injuries and the perpetrator had left traces of blood after cutting himself during the attack. Anders Eriksson is involved when the police in the West start a new cold case group in 2016 and the murder of Marie is one of the cases that the group takes on. - In terms of investigation, it is not a complicated matter in view of the forensic evidence. If we find the person who has deposited his DNA through blood, then it is the perpetrator, he says.  The big turnaround Despite phantom images, surveillance footage and tips from the public, the breakthrough was delayed. Only in 2022, when a woman in her 40s was busted after a minor theft, was her DNA matched to the findings from the murder scene. The police were sure they had found Marie's killer.  But the joy was short-lived. The woman was only 17 years old at the time of the murder, and the statute of limitations for murder of minors was then 15 years. The DNA meeting came about two years too late - and no trial could ever be held. - It's bad for everyone. There is no winner in that it has turned out the way it has with these rules, says Anders Eriksson. Sentenced for new crimes The woman who the police are sure is guilty of the murder was recently sentenced to prison for aggravated theft against the elderly in her work in home care. But she has never spoken publicly about Marie's murder.\n\nHow is it to know that we will most likely never come",

The trial began this week and is heavily covered by the media. In total, the indictment covers 38 points and the negotiations are expected to last for several months, partly behind closed doors. According to Leif GW Persson, there is a clear risk that the extensive reporting affects those who must take a position on the evidence. - There is, of course, a significant risk that it affects them. In this case, it is not to the benefit of the person charged, namely the bonus prince, says Persson in Nyhetsmorgon. Compare with the Dacosta trial Leif GW Persson draws parallels to Swedish legal cases where massive media attention had consequences for the legal process. He specifically cites the Dacosta trial as an example. - Justice feels good about being able to work in peace. But it won't be allowed to do that here, he says. According to Persson, the situation is further complicated by the fact that Høiby's mother, Crown Princess Mette-Marit, has recently been linked to the Epstein affair.  - It has nothing to do with his case, but it comes as an additional burden. He also seems to be feeling very unwell, and it is not to his advantage either, says Persson. Extensive prosecution - but uncertain outcome Among the 38 charges are four suspected rapes, one assault and crimes such as drug offences, vandalism and various forms of molestation. According to Persson, Høiby has partially admitted to some less serious crimes, but denies the assault and rape. - He will not be convicted on all counts. If he goes all the way, he risks up to 16 years in prison, but that will not be an issue, says Persson. He is also doubtful whether the trial will even lead to a prison sentence. - I am not even sure that he will be sentenced to prison. But I dare not speculate. \"Not extenuating\" According to Persson, the defense has emphasized Høiby's upbringing and that he lived most of his",

A day later, Otto Gernandt left his role as the company's CFO to take on an advisory role. The announcement from the green steel company is ominous, says Ossi Pesämaa, assistant professor of accounting and management at Luleå University of Technology. - Key people abandon ship, it's quite critical. A total of around SEK 70 billion has been invested in the green steel project. As a comparison, industry colleague SSAB's has a market capitalization of just over SEK 76 billion. - Stegra's loans are thus almost as large as one of Sweden's largest industrial groups. Add to that that Stegra is not even fully built, and in such a complex industrial plant there will be many elements and uncertainties even after completion, says Ossi Pesämaa. May need to double the loans According to Ossi Pesämaa, Stegra's facility is about 60 percent complete. Construction costs have skyrocketed and port construction has been put on hold. The financiers turn a blind eye. - Now you have applied for ten billion more, but if you are only halfway there, maybe another 70 billion is required - and maybe a little more. Where are they going to find that money now that the trust capital is at the bottom?, asks Ossi Pesämaa. Stegra's situation is increasingly reminiscent of bankrupt Northvolt. Stegra is structured in the same way and, just like Northvolt, has been able to show order books as security for financing. Now they are burdened - just as the battery law did - by multibillion-dollar debts and a trust that has run to rock bottom. - I think it is very likely that this will fall apart. The problem: Optimism bias Steel production worldwide accounts for around eight percent of global carbon dioxide emissions. In Sweden, the figure is around ten percent. It is therefore no wonder that green investments such as Stegra have gained popularity. In working condition, it would be a hyper-modern company with doubled steel production with non-existent colds",

Renat Mukmenov was sent to the front in the summer of 2024, and in mid-August communication ceased. - I suspect that the number of people considering signing a contract and going to war will only increase as the Russian economy slows down and wage increases slow down, says Alexander Kolyandr, visiting researcher at the Center for European Policy Analysis to the BBC.  15 times higher chance of dying The area of ​​Zabaikalsky kray, where Renat Mukmenov came from, is one of the poorest regions in Russia and, according to the analysis, has one of the highest rates of fatalities per capita. Residents of the region are 15 times more likely to die in the war than residents of Moscow. - Calm in the capitals and the North Caucasus has traditionally been very important for maintaining social order and stability in Russia, says Alexander Kolyandr. There are a couple of exceptions to the analysis. In some of Russia's poorest regions – Chechnya, Ingushetia and Karachay-Cherkessia – deaths per capita are on a par with the rich cities of Moscow and Saint Petersburg. Sent to the front instead of trial Over half of all dead are voluntary, mobilized or convicted criminals from correctional facilities. People who had no connection to the army before the outbreak of war. Defendants in criminal cases have fallen among the dead, compared to a year ago.",

Brandsta City Släcker's \"Rakt in i elden\" has been the favorite from the start and now goes directly to the final. The band's orange firefighter uniforms have also stood the test of time. - These are our original clothes since \"Kom och ta mig\" and they have ridden the fire truck with us before that, singer Glenn Borgkvist has told. In the pyrotechnics-dense number, where flames lick the edge of the stage and fly in the air almost constantly, it gets really hot in the thick jackets. Drummer Tom Börjesson has stated that it is important to get enough liquid. - We have heard that beer is supposed to be the best. Moved to tears It was a moved Felicia who wiped away the tears and barely managed to sing the opening of her song \"My system\" when she was presented as a finalist. - You mustn't cry, what a shame, she said on her way up to the stage. Felicia has been a favorite from the start with \"My system\", which has more techno and house vibes than her previous songs in the epadunk genre such as Fröken Snusk. The artist himself has speculated whether it might scare viewers away. - I think the song is one that goes better outside Sweden, she has said. She last competed in 2024, then with the song \"Young & free\" - which went on to the final qualification but fell on the finish line and missed the final. Then she felt mentally ill and the feeling is completely different now, she has told TT. - It cannot be compared to last time. I feel so good now and am so busy. It feels absolutely fantastic. Former Melodifestival winner Robin Bengtsson, who is participating for the fifth time, clinched the place in the final qualification with the country song \"Honey honey\". Sung gospel Melodifestivalen's second competition, which takes place in Gothenburg, got off to a flying start in the form of a gospel number. Hampus Nessvold, backed by a choir, sang about how Melodifestivalen is his religion. Previous win",

The high pressure literally pushes down the water, which is pushed out of the Baltic Sea. In Stockholm, the water level is now the lowest in at least 15 years, according to SMHI.  17th century wreck visible The weather phenomenon has caused the Orlogsfartyget at Kastellholmen in Stockholm to look forward. The shipwreck from the 17th century is 40 meters long and usually lies below the surface of the water. The ship has not been wrecked, but sunk on the spot, which means that the ship is very intact.  - When it was no longer worth repairing the ships, the navy reused the material and sunk them. It's a cool phenomenon, instead of using new wood, they use old ship scrap, says Jim Hansson, marine archaeologist at the Wreck Museum to Dagens Nyheter. But the low water levels have also caused it in its parts. Around 20 piers have been pulled into the Stockholm archipelago because the boats cannot dock. It is also difficult for the boats to dock at Strömkajen because the angle of the gangway is too steep. - Absolutely, it causes it, we have some piers where the boats cannot dock, says Helene Jakobsson, business area manager for sea traffic. But boat traffic is among the lowest of the year and Helene Jakobsson is not particularly concerned about the inhabitants of the archipelago. - There is an awareness of the power of the weather when you live out in the archipelago, she says. The pressure will release next week The long-term high pressure over Sweden will slowly but surely move away and turn into a low pressure. - The water level looks like it will drop another couple of days ahead, then turn around in the middle of the week, when the weather will be more low-pressure based according to the forecast, says Madeleine Westin. But even that can create problems, according to Madeleine Westin. As the ice spreads across the Baltic Sea, bridges can",

  "418bda8ecb4237e60fe5454fd93fed1a742fc58d": "After Sara Nilsson, one of the founders of the pedophile hunting site Dumpen, was convicted of defamation, the Sweden Democrats party leader Jimmie Åkesson swished money to her. He has also offered that SD should pay for the entire damages and legal costs, a sum of over half a million. Star lawyer Kristofer Stahre is now directing harsh criticism at Åkesson and SD. - If a crime is committed and the politicians do not agree with the legislation, they step in and pay the penalty. It sounds completely off the wall, he says to TV4 Nyheterna. \"Fish in murky waters\" He believes that the politicians should instead change the law if they are not satisfied with the legislation. - It sends completely wrong signals to the Swedish people. The fact that some people are above the law about it means that Jimmie Åkesson does not agree with the legislation. The lawyer sees major problems with the idea that one should be allowed to slander people if what is said is true. - That assessment is always made after the fact, and it risks affecting an awful lot of innocent people. Tidö has opened for a change in the law Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson (M) has previously opened for changing the defamation legislation so that, for example, you can warn neighbors about sex offenders in the neighborhood, something Stahre thinks you should be careful about. - I am afraid that you are fishing in cloudy waters. It is votes you are looking for before the election. You don't see the risks, says Kristofer Stahre. Jimmie Åkesson defends the payment in a debate article on Expressen. He calls the verdict a \"judicial scandalous splash\" and believes that Swedish defamation legislation has become a \"protection for predators\". Åkesson: \"Pull where the pepper grows\" Jimmie Åkesson responds to the criticism in a post on the platform X. This is what he writes: \"Pull where the pepper grows. Yes, it is unconventional as a legislator to pay a fine to an individual who has committed a crime. But, those of you who choose to focus on that instead of the absurdity of an honorable citizen being convicted for doing the morally right thing can pull the trigger",

She's only been here for two weeks but is already finding herself in the huge hospital. - Here I can come and get dialysis without all the noise of bombs, airplanes and helicopters, she says in a firm voice. She is one of the few children evacuated from Gaza for care. Right now, several different organizations believe that between 18-20,000 patients need to leave the Gaza Strip to receive better care. Last Monday, the Rafah border between Gaza and Egypt was opened and many hoped to be able to go to a better hospital outside Gaza.  But the process is both slow and complicated, which has meant that only around 100 patients plus their relatives were able to leave in just over a week. The patients in Amman have gone via the Kerem Shalom crossing, through Israel to Jordan. - The process is extremely slow, difficult and cumbersome. The king of Jordan has said that we will help 2,000 children but so far we have only managed to get 650 children out. I'm afraid that many will die because the wait is so long, says Fawzi Al-Hammouri doctor Specialty hospital. War injuries and a long wait The patients who have come to Amman are a mixture of children with war injuries, cancer or who need internal medicine.  Inside the physiotherapy, we meet the sisters Sarah, 15 and Saraa, 17. They were both badly injured when the house fell on them after a bomb attack in northern Gaza. Saraa was injured in the knees and operated on in Gaza and can now walk relatively well. But Sarah, who injured her neck and spine, could not get help on the spot. - I couldn't move my arms or legs. But it took 6 months before I could be evacuated from Gaza. Here in Amman they operated on me and through physiotherapy I have regained some of my strength, she says. Both sisters study remotely and want to become doctors and physiotherapists. - After what we have been through, we want to use the experience gained to help others, says Saraa. 10-year-old Rama will probably stay in Amman for a long time.

You must not say that I am selling for a certain purpose when it is a completely different purpose that I am selling for. Then you mislead consumers, says consumer advisor Maria Wiezell.

Jona Dervishi, coach in Gällivare SK, emphasizes the importance of the night trains for the club's business.  - It's super important, we live where we live and are far from everywhere. We always aim to go by train because it is the safest way to travel. We have competitions in Sundsvall, Västerås, Falköping, Gothenburg and various camps. The night trains affect our business a lot, says Jona Dervishi. Reduced opportunities for sports Traveling at night also means that the children do not have to take time off from school to travel to the competitions. The alternative of flying is too expensive. When the night trains north of Umeå are reduced from two to one, it becomes more difficult to find tickets that suit the club's needs.   - This means fewer competitions and it leads to fewer wrestlers, so our business will be significantly reduced, says Jona Dervishi. According to the government, the change is due to SJ taking over night train traffic at short notice at the end of 2024, which was expensive for the Swedish Transport Administration. The government has pushed for money, but no earmarked for double departures north of Umeå.   - It is, of course, important that there are good conditions for accessibility within and to and from Norrland and that is why the government allocates large funds to this type of procured traffic and we have pushed to a quarter of a billion since 2025, but at the same time it is important to get a handle on these costs, they cannot continue to rise and that is why the Swedish Transport Administration has been forced to this emergency brake. But the government has also tasked the Swedish Transport Administration with reviewing both the organization and financing of the state's night train fleet for the future, so we have a long-term solution to this, says infrastructure minister Andreas Carlsson (KD). Have been forced to pull the emergency brake Isn't it the government's job to secure train traffic throughout the country? - The government pushes to significant amounts, a quarter",

Several sources told the newspaper that President Zelenskyi will announce the election on February 24, the anniversary of the full-scale invasion. A high voter turnout is required At the same time, several sources state that the timetable is somewhat optimistic and that several factors affect whether it can actually happen, including how far you can get in the negotiations for a peace agreement. Zelenskyj has previously stated that it is not possible to hold an election when the country is in a state of emergency. Around 20 percent of the country is occupied by Russia and a large number of the country's citizens are on the run.  The pressure to hold an election is said to come from the United States, which reportedly wants to see an end to the war before mid-term elections in November. - They say they want everything ready by June, so that the war ends, says Zelenskyj and adds: - They want a clean schedule, says Zelenskyj, referring to the time before the mid-term elections.  One source states that at least half of the voters who were registered before the full-scale invasion must participate in the election - otherwise it may lack international legitimacy. Something that Russia could exploit.  \"He must bow to Trump\" TV4 Nyhetern's foreign commentator Johan Fredriksson believes that Trump and the American negotiators have been fed lies from Russia about an \"illegitimate Nazi regime\" ruling in Kiev. - Now Volodymyr Zelenskyj must in practice refute the lies and show the USA that his government has the support of the people. This despite the fact that Ukraine's constitution and election laws prohibit the conduct of presidential, parliamentary and local elections as long as the country is in a state of war, says Johan Fredriksson. At the same time, he believes that Zelenskyi has no other choice.  - He has to bow and bow to Trump and his ideas and now the White House has set an ultimatum: first carry out elections, then an agreement on military security",

Two people were found dead in a residence believed to be connected to the crime.  Police have not yet released the ages of the victims. Nor if the perpetrator is a minor or an adult.

The warning asked everyone in the area to stay inside, lock doors and not approach the school. Around 27 people are said to have been injured, two of whom have serious or life-threatening injuries. Floyd says police will not release the ages of the victims at this time. The small community of Tumbler Ridge, where the mass shooting took place, has about 2,400 residents.

Details: Arrested in a taxi A person has been arrested in a taxi near the crime scene, according to TV4 Nyhetern's information. It will be about a man in his 20s. He is now suspected of attempted murder. According to the TV4 Nyheternas reporter on the spot, the atmosphere was chaotic. The police were able to confirm on Tuesday that they are working with a larger resource at the scene, but not that any suspected perpetrator has been arrested. - What we can say is that we get an alarm about loud bangs and go there.

Man in his 20s arrested On Tuesday morning, the police announced that prosecutors had chosen to arrest a man in his 20s who had been arrested. He is suspected of attempted murder. According to the police, it is still too early to say whether the incident is gang-related. The classification is attempted murder.",

In the program, Marcus Andersson expresses that Marina Westerlund was his favorite of the three remaining girls - something that surprised her. - I am very shocked by what Marcus said. It would have been good if he told me. But I don't regret my decision. I felt nothing for Marcus. I would probably have gone home anyway, she says.  Marcus: Wouldn't have made any difference For TV4 Nyheterna, Marcus Andersson says that he doesn't think it would have made any difference if Marina Westerlund had been told that she was his favorite. - I guess I didn't really feel right for her either.

In total, they and the dog Aloka have walked over 370 miles before they now reach the American capital. - It's a bit like the great elk migration to follow these monks. What they create around them is very special, says Håkan Friedel, who is a Buddhist. Accidents and challenges on the way The walk has not been without difficulties. In Texas, a car crashed into the caravan, forcing one of the monks to have a leg amputated. In South Carolina, the dog Aloka needed surgery before he could continue. Despite the cold of the American winter, the monks have continued, often barefoot and sometimes without even lying down when sleeping. - These are very advanced donuts as far as I understand. So they take on a special exercise for themselves, for their own sake, to be able to reach deeper into themselves, says Håkan Friedel. Great commitment and meetings with politicians Thousands of people have followed the monks along the way and millions have become involved online. During the walk, they have stopped to talk to both ordinary people and politicians. - There are a lot of conflicts in America. It feels very right that the monks are out walking and talking to people. They stop and share what they have with them, says Håkan Friedel. The monks will participate in several events in Washington. They also plan to submit a request to Congress for the Buddha's birthday to be officially observed, although they themselves emphasize that the most important thing is meeting people. - Of course, the big overarching goal has been to walk for world peace, but it is undeniably the case, as a monk put it, that the goal has also been to get people along the way to stop and get distraction from the problems that weigh on them in everyday life, says Filip Jacobson, foreign correspondent.",

Unlike other eating disorders, Arfid is not about body ideals or weight, but about a strong reluctance or fear of food, often linked to taste, smell or texture. Klara Edlund, psychologist and researcher, emphasizes that Arfid is not about being picky or spoiled. - This is about a neurobiologically rooted eating disorder. It's about a strong inability to eat enough, which means you end up with both energy and nutritional deficiencies, says Klara Edlund. \"It comes physically from within\" Many people with Arfid describe a strong fear of negative consequences of eating, such as vomiting or choking. For Clara Lager, the fear has sometimes led to panic attacks and severe anxiety, even though she tries to have a positive attitude. - When that reflex comes and that discomfort comes, it's like I have no power over it. It comes physically from within. It's not something I get for myself, but I want to be able to eat like everyone else, she says. Treatment with CBT Klara Edlund urges you to seek help via a health centre, BVC or school nurse if you suspect Arfid in yourself or your child. Despite the fact that knowledge of Arfid is low, there is help to be had.

  "630e51f250e2b195a916ab9d755d8a333df0579d": "After Sara Nilsson, one of the founders of the pedophile hunting site Dumpen, was convicted of defamation, the Sweden Democrats party leader Jimmie Åkesson swished her money. He has also offered that SD should pay for the entire damages and legal costs - a sum of over half a million kroner. The action is not only problematic, but it also violates the constitution, says lawyer and former Social Democratic Minister of Justice Thomas Bodström. It is clearly stated in the form of government that members of the Riksdag may not intervene in individual cases. - When he gets involved in how courts should judge by criticizing them, he has crossed a very important line. Politicians must not rule the courts. And that is precisely what we criticize Trump for all the time, he tells TV4 Nyheterna. \"It's nonsense and everyone understands it\" In a debate article in Expressen, Bodström writes together with lawyer Hanna Larsson Rampe that Åkesson's and SD's donations encourage a convicted person to continue committing crimes. \"SD's rhetoric is that those of us who dare to criticize Dumpen's actions would rather protect the pedophiles than the children. It is nonsense and anyone who thinks about it understands that. Nor can they justify their actions by saying that sexual abuse of children is a heinous crime, because this is a view that basically everyone shares,\" write the lawyers. They also express a concern that Jimmie Åkesson may be part of a future government, and specifically as Minister of Justice - which the party leader has explicitly said he wants to be. - If you are in the government, you have enormous power and can pardon anyone without reasonable grounds. If he were to become Minister of Justice, he would, for example, have the right to pardon Sara Nilsson, says Bodström to TV4 Nyheterna. Åkesson: \"We take the initiative to do it\" Jimmie Åkesson has \"no understanding whatsoever\" of the criticism surrounding the Dumpen swish, he tells TV4 Nyheterna. - It is a way to signal very clearly that we think the defamation legislation is wrong and needs to be changed.

  "141a5f3127f86e751a459a957a894f2fdec73cf2": "The 30-year-old was detained last weekend by the Västmanland district court. During the hearing, the man admitted to the crime of sabotage and agreed to be detained. - He admits that he was there, that's what I can say, says District Attorney Magnus Möller, who has the case on his table. Arrested on the run The incident took place at 02.30 on January 30. The police were then alerted to Mälarenergi's facility in Västerås. The power at the Hässlö waterworks had been cut off after a sabotage against the electrical installations inside the protected area. A police patrol was able to quickly track down the saboteur and arrested the 30-year-old when he tried to run from the scene. According to information to TV4 Nyheterna, the man was wearing a cap with the Russian coat of arms when he was arrested. - We do not go into more detail about what information we have or what our cooperation with the Police Authority looks like in individual cases, says Jonathan Svensson, press spokesperson at the Security Police, Säpo. Unknown motive The 30-year-old man has appeared in the legal system since a young age and has a long criminal record with several serious crimes. He has been sentenced together with, among others, a well-known leader of a notorious criminal network and has been involved in high-profile gang cases. Säpo has previously come out and warned of increased threats of sabotage from Russia. However, the prosecutor does not want to comment on the information that the detainee had the Russian state coat of arms. - There is preliminary investigation secrecy, so I cannot go into details. I must point out that there will be a preliminary investigation protocol where it will appear, says Magnus Möller. According to the prosecutor, no motive behind the nocturnal sabotage has yet been discovered. - So far we don't have that. But he will be interrogated once more and it may become clearer then, says Magnus Möller. \"Very serious\" According to Mälarenergi, the sabotage did not lead to any impact on the quality of the drinking water. - But due to the power outage at the Hässlö waterworks on the night of January 30, the waterworks could not supply drinking water",

  "402332fe1356aa00d70d52264090d5dab646d6ea": "When Malmö city inspectors recently visited a wholesale company, 5.2 tons of approximately one-year-old candy were discovered that were about to be relabeled with new best-before dates. This is reported by the news agency Siren. Two people who were working on packaging goods in connection with ten pallets of candy boxes immediately left the premises when the inspectors showed up, according to the environmental administration.  - We are doing outreach to inventory premises, including in this area, which is densely packed with wholesalers. When two people stick out immediately when we arrive, it of course arouses our interest, says unit manager Caroline Tandefelt to Nyhetsbyrån Siren. On a follow-up visit, those in charge stated that the candy had accidentally not been disposed of. \"In the premises there were prepared packing surfaces, empty new cartons, unused bags for repackaging, tape, sealing machine and solvents in the form of acetone and nail polish remover with the aim of removing labels and erasing the best before date\", writes the environmental administration in its decision. Cat chasing mice The spaces in the premises were also dirty and unhygienic. Among other things, a cat had been placed there to keep mice and vermin away. \"There was a litter box in the toilet and cat food was stored in the fridge,\" the decision states. In recent years, the wholesale company has been the subject of several controls and banning decisions.  Contact with Danish colleagues The delivery in question, which according to the environmental administration had come from the Netherlands, is still taped up in the premises and is to be destroyed under the supervision of the municipality - We have also been in contact with our Danish colleagues on the other side of the strait. It is about a very large volume, and overall the data we have indicates a certain systematicity, says Caroline Tandefelt to News Agency Siren. The property where the environmental administration's raid took place is owned by another company with partly the same group of owners. Several wholesale companies in the food industry have their warehouses nearby.",

  "bc93af5c72c807b977b09509cb2ee6ef7d4a655c": "The accident occurred during the bench press WC in Eskilstuna on January 25. After lifting 170 kilos, Livia Blomqvist, 23, tried to break the Nordic record of 178 kilos. During the lift, she heard a crack - and then another - as the bar ended up at the wrong angle and both arms broke. - Then it felt like in that second the dream of the World Cup came crashing down, says Livia Blomqvist in Nyhetsmorgon.  \"The second time in my life I've heard of this\" Blomqvist competed in the so-called equipped bench press, a technical branch where everything has to be right. She says that her shoulder blades gave way, causing the bar to go backwards towards her head. The arm ended up at such a bad angle that the leg came off and she lost control of the bar - then the other arm came off too.  Chief physician Mikael Sandström states that it is very unusual for athletes to break both arms at the same time. - It is the second time in my life I have heard about this, says Sandström. Despite the injury, Blomqvist managed to qualify for both the WC and EC, but now awaits a long rehabilitation.  - I try to maintain my body as much as possible and hope to be able to train lighter weights as soon as possible, she says. Tough way back Despite the setback, Blomqvist is determined to get back to the competition scene. She continues to train what she can and hopes that the injury may even give her body time to heal old wear and tear. - If only I can train 40 kilos in the bench press, it will do a lot for my strength, says Blomqvist. The doctors have prescribed at least twelve weeks of rest from heavy load, which makes the WC in May unlikely. Blomqvist is now aiming to be back at the EC in August. - You'll see how the body responds, but I've made up my mind that the EC in August is a more realistic goal.",

In her social media, she has promoted defense spray, something that has led to a positive response from women who she states bought the product after her videos. From the men, the reactions have looked different. - They were very negative about my video and commented a lot. That we imagine that we are so vulnerable. They probably wanted to ridicule it a little in some way, says Amanda Blom.  Defense spray may be carried and used in Sweden for self-defense in an emergency situation. Johanna Björkman, legal expert, explains where the line is drawn between emergency protection and assault. - You always have to defend yourself against, for example, an unprovoked or ongoing attack. But you must never be the one who initiates something by starting to use this spray, for example unnecessarily or to ward off someone who may not have an intention at all or has misunderstood something, says Johanna Björkman.  \"The body thinks it's burning\" Defense spray is legal, unlike pepper spray, which is illegal to possess, buy or bring into Sweden. Chemist Johanna Thompson explains what the various products contain and how they affect the body.  - In both cases, it is a hijacking of the body's own defense system, says Johanna Thompson.  Pepper spray contains the active substance capsaicin, which is extracted from chili fruit.  - The body thinks it's on fire. It is an immediate, inflammatory, very strong reaction, says Johanna Thompson.  She also says that it can cause shortness of breath and lasting pain. Unlike pepper spray, defense spray instead gives signals of extreme cold.  - Here we have a base of menthol in most cases and solvents that will help the menthol to cross the protective membrane of the eye, says Johanna Thompson.

The Trump administration plans this week to overturn a scientific decision from Barack Obama's time as president that is the basis for large parts of the United States' climate policy, The Wall Street Journal reports. If the decision is implemented, it will be the most extensive dismantling of the country's climate policy to date. It is about the so-called \"endangerment finding\" from 2009, where it was determined that six greenhouse gases pose a threat to human health and welfare. The decision has been the legal basis for the environmental authority EPA's climate rules, including emission limits for power plants and stricter fuel requirements for vehicles. - This is the largest deregulation in the history of the United States, says EPA director Lee Zeldin. Trump has called climate change a hoax Trump already tried during his first term to weaken or dismantle parts of the US's climate regulations. The American president has previously called climate change \"the biggest hoax\" ever invented by man. - The carbon footprint is a hoax invented by people with evil intentions, and it points the way to total destruction, he said in a speech to the UN General Assembly last year. The new decision, which is expected to be announced later this week, removes requirements for measuring, reporting, certifying and complying with federal emission standards for motor vehicles. Also associated control programs, credit systems and reporting requirements for the industry are to be abolished, according to the administration. However, the change does not apply to rules for emissions from power plants and other stationary sources, such as oil and gas facilities. But overturning the original decision could pave the way for those rules to be dismantled as well, writes The Wall Street Journal. The criticism: Could endanger millions of lives The fossil fuel industry is expected to be the big winner - which has long opposed federal climate regulations.

The countries receive a score between 0 and 100 – where higher scores mean less corruption.\n\nThis year, Denmark, Finland and Singapore top the list, while South Sudan, Somalia and Venezuela end up at the bottom. Sweden gets 80 points, which is a clear drop from 89 ten years ago. Three areas stand out According to Transparency International Sweden, there are three areas that particularly affect Sweden's results. Organized crime with infiltration and illicit influence poses a serious threat to welfare systems. - It is about organized crime with infiltration, unauthorized influence, extortion and the like. Where companies are used as criminal tools, for example, says Ulrik Åshuvud.\n\nIn addition, Sweden lags behind in transparency and control in public procurement, where several cases of pure corruption have been noticed. - There is a lot of money in procurement. These are large public resources. Over a trillion, i.e. a thousand billion, is procured for in public Sweden today, says Ulrik Åshuvud.\n\nFinally, conflicts of interest are raised, where the ability to refrain from participating in decisions is questioned. - The third thing that we usually talk about is conflicts of interest, that is, the ability to take a step back and realize that maybe you shouldn't be part of the decision-making process or that you shouldn't influence certain decisions, says Ulrik Åshuvud. Political integrity questioned Before the 2022 election, Kalla revealed the facts that five out of eight parties in the Riksdag were prepared to receive secret contributions to the election campaign, which may have affected Sweden's position. - That made us change our direction quite a lot.

According to the indictment, he threatened the girlfriend to send a former client on her. The woman testifies that he says his clients will do \"anything\" for him, gave her the name of a convicted felon and threatened to have a \"quick talk\" with her. Recorded the conversation The lawyer also threatened to counter-report the woman for rape if she went ahead with a police report, something she recorded with the phone: \"You say you're going to report me for rape,\" she says in the recording. \"Yes, I will have to,\" he replies. When asked why he needs it, he replies that he has to \"protect himself\". \"Okay, so you protect yourself. There's no reason to report anyone, is it?

It was when he died that a statue in a park outside the hotel became a pilgrimage site for grieving fans.  In a bizarre dispute over the years, two rival gangs of Jackson lovers emerged who claimed the makeshift monument as theirs. They tore down each other's tributes in nocturnal raids. But for the next few days, the Jackson gang will be allowed to continue their rivalry out of sight. The monument is located within the security zone for the annual security conference in Munich. Kristersson and three ministers on site Prime Minister Kristersson is coming from Sweden with three ministers. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is there, of course, along with around 60 other leaders, such as Ukraine's Zelensky. That J.D. Vance not attending has raised many questions. Does that mean the Trump administration has decided to lower the temperature?  Extending a \"We Are the World\"-like olive branch to European leaders? Or will Secretary of State Marco Rubio give an equally confrontational speech? The so-called peace plan for Ukraine will be discussed. The so-called cease-fire in Gaza will be dissected. The so-called arrest of Venezuela's Maduro will be criticized, at least somewhat quietly, and the so-called negotiations on the future of Greenland will be high on the agenda. A circus even outside the hotel Outside the congress, we can expect a Jackson-like circus. Hundreds of thousands of exiled Iranians are expected to demonstrate Saturday against the country's rule, and the son of Iran's last shah will speak.  Thousands of Ukrainians – as well as opponents of continued support for Ukraine – will also be out in the streets. Around 5,000 police officers are on site. But above all, all numbers will be analyzed down to the smallest detail. Will this be another nail in the coffin for the Western alliance? Or it gets a respite after some tough ones",

On Thursday, he was sentenced to prison for serious accounting offenses against his denial, which TV4 Nyheterna reported on. Emanuel Karlsten, journalist and chairman of the Media Academy, believes that the verdict can have several positive effects. - This may put an end to the circus that has been. By the \"circus\" he refers to the influencer market on platforms such as YouTube and Tiktok, where content creators have made a lot of money on, what it seemed, completely their own terms. \"The Internet is not a total free zone\" Karlsten believes that this sentence, together with the sentence against Christofer \"Crippa\" Lundström, can help set the boundaries in the YouTube world. - These are two examples of how the internet is not a total free zone, but an arena where influencers must play by the same rules as everyone else. He believes that the judges will become warning examples for future content creators. - There will surely be more judgments of this type. The influencer market has been the wild west for a long time. It may be easy to believe that you live in a parallel universe with an audience of millions, but you live in the real world. - Now there will be a reference. In both Pontus and Chrippa's case, it has been a matter of a lack of basic accounting skills. It will be easier to refer to these two judgments in the future. \"Not a world for him\" Furthermore, Emanuel Karlsten believes that the verdict is positive for Pontus Rasmusson personally. - It is obvious that this is not a world for him. He hasn't been able to handle it. He made sexualized content for his child audience, an obvious misstep. Then he doesn't get his basic paperwork in order and is now in prison.

The EU now recommends that member states offer screening from the age of 50, but in Sweden the starting age is still 60. The National Board of Health and Welfare justifies its decision by saying that there is a lack of sufficient scientific evidence that screening between the ages of 50 and 59 would reduce mortality, and that there is a lack of staff and the risk of unequal care. - We don't understand how the National Board of Health and Welfare has thought here, says Birger Pålsson, docent and chief physician. He participated in the National Board of Health and Welfare's expert group that recommended starting screening at the age of 50. He estimates that between 50 and 100 people in the age group 50–59 per year could be saved if screening were introduced earlier. - What we have criticized very harshly is that there is a large amount of international scientific reports that unanimously show this. The National Board of Health and Welfare has not reviewed the modern scientific literature. We were only tasked with reviewing four articles and they are a little old at this point. But paradoxically, most of them also recommend starting at age 50, says Pålsson. Spotted a lump Lotta Hammar was diagnosed at the age of 53, by which time the cancer had already spread. She says that the symptoms were unclear and that she first suspected menopause. - I thought: I'm tired, it's menopause. I'm getting rounder, it's menopause. I blamed it all on: It must be the menopause. It wasn't in my world that it would be something, she says in Efter fem. It wasn't until she discovered a lump the size of a tennis ball sticking out of the left side of her stomach that she checked it out. By then she had been suffering from fatigue and other symptoms for a year. - It had gone so far that I had colon cancer that had spread metastases. So it had gone way too far.

So thick that Ylva von Wright and a friend took on a challenge: to get as close to Sweden as possible on cross-country skates. - We guessed that we would come across a chute with open water, but we wanted to see how far we could go, says Ylva von Wright to TV4 Nyheterna. Ylva and the friend, who are studying to become wilderness guides, had time to get about eight kilometers out on the water before they started to encounter ice banks. The first embankment was still, but a couple of hundred meters out they heard the sound of embankments moving. - We got to experience a fantastic natural phenomenon. What I like about the ice that makes it so fascinating is that you can never plan anything ahead of time because the conditions can change so quickly. \"Risk of being separated from land\" According to SMHI, ice dams can form when the ice is pressed against land or other larger blocks of ice. For this, however, it is required that the ice is thicker than 15-20 centimeters.  The flakes that form the dykes are not usually frozen together, and Ylva and her friend became aware of this when the ice began to crack a little further out. Even the innermost dike began to move over time. - There was a risk that we would end up on an ice floe and be separated from the coast, so it was best to turn around. You must be aware of the risks and respect nature when you go out on the ice. However, they never felt any direct concern. - Since we were in the archipelago, we were quite close to islands, so it didn't feel like we were that far out, says Ylva von Wright. Had food for two days Since the plan was to get as close to the Swedish coast as possible, Ylva von Wright and her friend had really tickled themselves. In addition to the usual equipment of ice spikes, throwing line and dry clothes packed in waterproof sacks, they carried food for two days and four liters of water each. Did you think you would reach Sweden? - No, it was more of a fun idea. You would have needed a packraft to get over the chute. At certain times of the day you can cross the gutter",

He says that he often felt misunderstood as to why he was so absent. - They didn't understand how tough it was trying to support the family, how expensive everything is and how hard it is to make an action film.  - But at the same time, they probably miss that they didn't really know their father, says Dolph Lundgren. The daughter: \"He had his own demons\" Greta Lundgren grew up in Spain with her mother and older sister Ida and felt very abandoned as a child. Now, when Greta is older, she can understand the choices her father made. - I understand that he needed to do that and I think he had his own demons. He needed to be away working. It was good for him. He probably knew it wasn't good that he was with us every day. He wanted to spare us from that, so he stayed away.  When Dolph Lundgren started going to therapy as a 50-year-old, he decided to repair the relationship with his two daughters and apologize for how absent he had been. - It was when I was around 50 myself that I started to come to grips with my own trauma from my childhood. It reflects on how I behaved in life. I had a very tough upbringing with my father who was very violent towards me, he says.

  "bb609c44a066babb45dfbd394fefa5ac5bbb120f": "In large parts of northern Europe and North America, January this year has been colder than normal. In Sweden, temperature deficits were noted throughout the country, especially in the northern parts, where in places it was down to eight degrees colder than normal.  - You must also distinguish between weather and climate. We have cold weather right now. But the climate is warmer and is warming up, says meteorologist Peter Kondrup. Jet streams are affected by climate change At the same time as the cold has taken hold in Sweden, South America and Australia have been affected by heat waves and fires. Peter Kondrup explains that the jet streams, which normally move across the Northern Hemisphere, have become slower and more elongated because the polar regions are warming faster than the equator. This leads to larger and slower oscillations, which can produce both colder and warmer periods than normal.  - There can be very large but slow, tough swings. It is an effect of climate change, of global warming. \"We have a bad memory\" The past twelve years have been the warmest globally, and 2025 was the third warmest year to date. Although this year's January is perceived as cold, it is a mild winter in a longer historical perspective.  - We experience January 2026 as very cold, but compare it to the war winters of the 1940s, then it appears as a pale copy. It was really cold then. Or in the 80s.  For the past 20 years, we have experienced unusually mild winters in Sweden, which may have made us forget how cold it can actually be in winter. - We feel that it is cold and it is a little colder than it has been in a few years. Our memory is quite short. We've gotten used to this global warming, and when it gets a little colder than normal, we think it's freezing cold, says Peter Kondrup.",

There she was accused of theft because she had brought food waste home - and was fired.  - I was completely speechless and thought it was a joke. It came out of nowhere, I hadn't even been told.  Marie enjoyed her work very well and describes it as a shock when the news came - two days before her 50th birthday.  - I decided then and there that it wasn't right. You shouldn't behave that way. Sued the employer Marie sued her employer Skurup Municipality a year and a half ago. Her representative Bo Villner believes that the employer's action was disproportionate and believes that there were other solutions to the situation.  - Our opinion is that it is a trivial incident. There's no reason to believe she wouldn't have stopped if only she had been asked. Why an employer chooses to do so is difficult to know, he believes.  - It can be due to several things. You can have prestige behind it or you dislike someone and want to get rid of them. But this is a bit like cracking nuts with a sledgehammer.

To this day, Marie has not received any explanation as to why she was not given a warning or notice. - If they had told me to stop it, of course I would have done it. Now she hopes her case can help others in similar situations. - I stand up for myself and maybe this can support someone else too.

It is the sixth flight of Ariane 6, but the first with four boosters – a configuration known as Ariane 64. The rocket can now lift about 21.6 tonnes into low orbit, more than double that of previous versions.  The goal of today's launch is to place 32 satellites into orbit, as part of Amazon's rollout of a satellite-based internet system.  European competitiveness in space Ariane 6 is developed to give Europe independent and competitive access to space, the Swedish Space Agency writes on its blog. The version has a longer nose cone than before and is the largest Ariane 6 to date. The rocket is 62 meters, equivalent to a high-rise building with 20 floors. The increased capacity means that larger and heavier loads can be launched at the same time, which is crucial when the number of satellites in orbit is rapidly increasing. Clear Swedish contributions Sweden contributes to the Ariane 6 program via the European Space Agency ESA.  The company GKN Aerospace in Trollhättan develops and manufactures, among other things, nozzles and turbines for the rocket's engines.  \"The launch marks an important step for Europe's space transport and shows how European cooperation, with contributions from several countries, strengthens Europe's ability to reach and use space,\" writes the Swedish Space Agency.",

Rönning resident Patrik Fransson has made it to Stockholm to attend. - I feel that I want to be here to show respect for the family, he says. He hopes that the funeral will be an opportunity for people to come together. - I see quite a lot of hatred and strong emotions. I think it is good that people can come into contact with each other and share feelings together and unite in love, he says. \"Hope they can move on\" Delmon Haffo, a moderate municipal politician in Salem, is also present, but more as a concerned Rönningebo than as a politician, he says.\n\n- For me, it is very important to show support to the family and everyone involved and to show that society is behind them, he says. He didn't know My personally, but knew who she was. They had several mutual friends. - I am above all here because I was touched by something incredible that this could happen in Rönninge, he says. - I hope it will be a nice end to the family's grief work. I hope that they get the opportunity to move on and that we get a church filled with love. The family's statement: \"The loss is bottomless\" My's family does not want to talk to the press in connection with the funeral, but yesterday they shared this statement: We want to thank everyone who has shown us warmth, care and support. It means a lot to us. Our beloved daughter, My, loved sunsets, seas and open horizons. She was curious and brave and stood firm in her convictions, with an obvious respect for others. My spoke more about the world than about herself and never gave up on what she believed in.

But the court states that he was aware that he was running a business subject to bookkeeping and that he was completely indifferent to whether the bookkeeping met the requirements.

The next day, her brother Andreas Törnkvist reported her missing. A large search effort was launched, Missing People was called in and over 200 people volunteered to participate in the search. Three months after she disappeared, she was found dead in a lake, wrapped in a blanket in a garbage bag - at the same time her 56-year-old Juha Marttila was arrested. Today he was sentenced to 18 years in prison for murder and violation of grave peace. - The district court has, after an examination of a series of circumstantial evidence, concluded that it is beyond reasonable doubt that the man killed the woman and then moved the body in the way that the prosecutor has claimed. Other perpetrators can be excluded, says court president Anne Olsson.  Got an early tip about the roommate In the investigation, it appears that the police had been keeping an eye on Juha Marttila for some time. Relatives had stated that they got a strange feeling when they talked to him. Missing People also alerted the police to Juha Marttila. After searching for a week, they advised the police that they wanted to do an internal search. Then he had contacted an acquaintance to move furniture in the home. The partner must also have stated that they had recently broken up. \"Missing People got bad vibes from this. First, that they had broken up just before the disappearance, but also that he was so careful to move under furniture right after Missing People's phone call,\" writes the police who received the tip.  Had similar garbage bags at home The same kind of garbage bags that she was found in were also found in Juha Marttila's residence. The fibers that were in the blanket were also found in his car and on thresholds in the home.  The prosecutor said that they had extensive technical evidence and that several interrogations pointed to Juha Marttila as having committed the murder. He had strangled her to death and then moved the body and left it in the lake. Juha Marttila has always denied it",

The shutdown, which lasted a total of seven hours, meant, among other things, that no planes could take off from the international airport in the city. The reason behind the shutdown is that drones belonging to Mexican drug cartels have crossed the border, says US Transport Minister Sean Duffy on X. Used super weapon The US responded by resorting to a weapon they had never used before, reports the Reuters news agency. According to sources with insight, it is a kind of anti-drone weapon with direct energy technology - i.e. the same type of technology that the US is suspected of having used in connection with the strike against Venezuela's now deposed President Nicolás Maduro. Neither the Pentagon nor AeroVironment, the company behind the drone, have commented on the data. When the information about the drone came from Mexico, the FAA initially said that the airport in El Paso would remain closed for up to ten days.  Delayed Valentine's Day trip Two people affected by the stop were Jorge Rueda and Yamilexi Meza who were scheduled to fly to Portland, Oregon for a Valentine's Day trip. - I am happy that ten days became only two hours for us, Jorge Rueda told AP after their flight was rebooked.

  "28d727c8b92e9ac0fbfd1ddacf2a7fc1cef2713f": "Foul-smelling packages have been placed along Finland's eastern border to stop rabies from entering the country. The packages contain fish-scented baits with vaccines, specially formulated for wild predators such as foxes and raccoons. The background is reports of rabies cases in the Moscow region of Russia. Despite that, the situation is calm, according to the experts. - Bait vaccines have been distributed every year since the early 1990s. It is a proven and effective method to prevent the spread of rabies, says Tiina Nokireki, senior researcher at the Swedish Food Agency, to the Finnish Ilta Sanomat.  Rabies-free for 30 years Finland has been classified as rabies-free for around 30 years. The vaccines are being distributed across the southeastern border, which is considered the most likely route for the infection to enter from Russia. Last fall, around 180,000 vaccine doses were released in the area. But despite the outbreak in Moscow, the risk has not increased, emphasizes Nokireki. - Vaccines have also been distributed on the Russian side, and besides, the distance is long. Animals don't move such long distances, she tells the newspaper. Do not touch the baits - vaccinate your pets The vaccine baits smell really bad and should be left alone. If humans touch them, animals may avoid them due to human weathering. It is also not advisable to come into contact with the vaccine solution inside the bait. At the same time, the authorities remind us of the importance of vaccinating pets. - Dogs and cats should be vaccinated against rabies throughout the country, says Nokireki. Should rabies still reach Finland, it is more likely that the infection will first spread to pets and then on to humans - rather than humans being infected directly by wild animals, according to the Finnish Food Agency.",

The percentage of unemployed has decreased to 6.8 percent at the end of January compared to 7.2 percent a year ago, according to the statistics.  Compared to previous months, however, there is a marginal increase in the number of unemployed. - We often see a certain increase around the turn of the year, so that figure is no surprise. If we take seasonal patterns into account, we instead see a continued reduction in unemployment, and that for the sixth month in a row, says Eva Samakovlis, director of analysis at Arbetsförmedlingen. That county is the best Norrbotten county has the country's lowest unemployment (3.9 percent). Skåne and Södermanland's counties are in the second bracket, with unemployment rates of 8.9 and 8.5 percent respectively. Youth unemployment is also decreasing. In total, roughly 40,000 young people aged 18 to 24 were registered with the Employment Service at the end of January. This is a decrease of just over 4,000 compared to the same period last year. At the same time as the percentage of the unemployed is decreasing, the Swedish Employment Agency sees an increase in the long-term unemployed.

In Munich, where the annual security conference was taking place in parallel, German police said around 250,000 people took part in the demonstration. Reza Pahlavi himself attended the security conference and spoke, among other things, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. \n\nPahlavi also attended the demonstration where he gave a speech. - We tell all grieving families that they are not alone. As a child, father, husband and brother, I understand the pain of the grieving families. Not a day has passed without me shedding tears, but these tears give me energy, he told the large crowd at the venue. US Senator Lindsey Graham also spoke at the demonstration and expressed support for the Iranian people's struggle for democracy. \n\n- Help is on the way, he said during his speech. An estimated 350,000 people gathered in Toronto and about the same number attended in Los Angeles. In Britain, police reported that 50,000 people took part in the demonstrations. The participants chanted slogans against the Iranian regime and expressed support for the relatives of the thousands of people killed during the protests in Iran more than a month ago.\n\nThousands also gathered in Stockholm and Gothenburg to demonstrate against the Iranian regime.",

  "ce6a0996875e9eb6645862e487fbf690d8be574c": "Every season, an average of 1,650 children over the course of a year need hospital care due to RS virus infection. In a country with good healthcare, it is not a fatal disease, but worried parents come to the children's emergency room with babies who have difficulty breathing when the cough, fever and phlegm hit. Small children's airways are more seriously affected by the RS virus, so they may need breathing support in the form of oxygen. When small children get sick with a high fever, they may find it difficult to eat, and then they get a tube down their stomach with nutrition, says Susanne Strömdahl, infectious disease doctor and investigator at the Norwegian Public Health Agency. The very youngest children, who are only a few months old, can sometimes suffer from breathing pauses, so-called apneas. Hope for a turning point Now there is hope for a turning point, which could lead to a significantly reduced burden on children's healthcare during the winter months - and reduced suffering for the very smallest. Since September 10 last year, newborns are offered an injection with antibodies against the RS virus. A majority of parents have agreed. It is not surprising, but it is very gratifying that the majority choose to accept with the big win for the smallest children to be protected for the first winter season. Is it revolutionary? Yes, it is based on the international data we see reported, says Susanne Strömdahl. Not one hundred percent. She describes the medicine as safe. So far, there have been five reports of side effects in Sweden, and in those cases it has mainly been a fine dotted rash or redness and swelling at the injection site. The antibodies provide good, but not 100% protection against serious illness. After the treatment began to be offered, the Public Health Agency has only received reports of a few children who received antibodies and still suffered RS virus infection. We expect a large protective effect. But in this situation, we are just at the beginning of the spread of infection. We had the start of the season in week five. The advice to protect babies from meeting cold people outside is approached",

Are they a natural part of the festive season or do they just cause unnecessary suffering to animals and people? On February 17, the defense committee will consider several received motions concerning bans or restrictions on fireworks. Before that, 13 organizations have come together and written an open letter urging the committee to take the motions seriously and consider a total ban on fireworks for private individuals.  Can suffer lifelong hearing damage The letter has been signed by several animal welfare organizations, but also by blue light personnel, including the Swedish Police Association.\n\n- Today, we mainly have hearing damage that is sometimes lifelong and that you can't do anything about. We don't have, pepper pepper, no cops that have had any of these pyrotechnics in the face or anything like that. But on the day it happens, considering how potent these fireworks are, we run the risk of even worse injuries or death, says Björn Johnsson, regional head security representative of the Swedish Police Association. In a survey among the members of the Police Association, 13 percent of police officers on external duty answered that they had been fired upon with fireworks. The industry does not believe that bans solve problems The industry does not believe that a ban would have solved this type of problem. \n\n- It would have reduced some ordinary fireworks and not least it would have reduced for those who are law abiding and already behave themselves. On the other hand, the rather large part of illegal fireworks imports had certainly increased. It's already big and it wouldn't disappear, unfortunately, says Martin Hildeberg, treasurer of Sweden's Pyrotechnic Industry Association.\n\nBut Björn Johnsson of the Swedish Police Association does not agree that a ban would mainly affect the law-abiding.\n\n- I think we have passed that stage. About 13 percent of our police officers feel that this is a problem and ambulance and rescue personnel",

The White House blamed the release of the video on a staff member, and it was deleted after a while. In a podcast, Obama is asked to comment on US discourse, and host Brian Tyler Cohen brings up the monkey video. It is important to remember that a majority of the American population finds this behavior deeply troubling, Obama said in the podcast, according to the BBC. He also says that it is a kind of \"clown show\" that takes place on social media and on television. There seems to be no shame in this among people who used to feel they had to have some sort of decency.",

  "c37de03fc58e55c3246925a74de56a370dddb21a": "The text was written during World War II by William \"Wild Bill\" Donovan, head of the Office of Strategic Services which later became the CIA. The manual was published in 2008. In the last month, it has been downloaded nearly 60,000 times and is now the fifth most popular e-book on Project Gutenberg, an American literature project that works to make available literature that is not covered by copyright. Small actions slow down the system The manual describes so-called \"simple sabotage\". It is about everyday behaviors that, if repeated, can make it difficult for a bureaucracy to function. Among the advice is to: Give long speeches and drag out meetings.  Bring up side issues and discuss details unnecessarily.  \"Misunderstanding\" instructions, asking many questions and delaying answers. It is also suggested to play dumb, be as annoying and argumentative as possible without breaking rules, as well as to stop talking when representatives of the regime enter a room. The purpose, according to the authors, is to make the work of the police and security services more difficult, but also to give ordinary people a way to show resistance to decisions they perceive as unacceptable. Attention in today's USA Why the manual has gone viral right now is unclear. According to the online newspaper 404 Media, the interest coincides with a period of unrest and change in the American workplace, especially among government employees. Questions of loyalty, reorganizations and new demands on employees have become more common in a more polarized political climate. During Donald Trump's time in power, discussions about the role of the state and the independence of the authorities have again taken place in the public debate. In that context, the old CIA manual has received new attention among some readers. On a large online forum for government employees, one of the most-read posts is headlined: \"To my colleagues, especially veterans: we are at war.\" There, the manual is shared primarily as a historical document – ​​and as a basis for discussion.",

The 20-year-old from Örby in Västergötland promised more energy after Friday's rehearsal and now it is clear that her contribution has gone home with the viewers. She debuted with the contribution \"Hate you so much\" last year, won her preliminary competition and finished in twelfth and last place in the final. This year, Ludvigsson describes his contribution as a little more cocky, more mature and darker. Favorite love song Hip-hop duo Medina predicted their chances as good with the contribution \"Viva l'amor\" on Valentine's Day. It also went down well with the audience, the contribution received the most votes. Made up of veterans Sami Rekik and Ali Jammali, Medina were favorites from the start. The duo has previously come in third and second place in the Melodifestivalen and has stated during the week that it would be like a \"fairy tale\" if they win the entire competition this year. As recently as January, Sami Rekik took a timeout due to physical and mental exhaustion. However, it is not something that has been noticed during the rehearsals this week. With a massive confetti rain of red hearts, a torchlight parade and dancers with maximum energy, Medina has lived up to expectations. The youngest participant in the qualifiers, Eva Jumatate, took third place and thus goes to the finals with the entry \"Selfish\". She is the youngest participant in Melodifestivalen 2026 and has previously said that it feels nerve-wracking to make her debut, but that the fact that she is participating in her hometown of Kristianstad has calmed her nerves. When Jumatate participated in Talent as a ten-year-old, she moved Bianca Ingrosso to tears. Eight years later, she once again performs a ballad that has proven to be a hit on TV sofas.

In the historic setting, surrounded by snow and sun, 26 people chose to get married – some before God and others before the state.  Wanted to create something new Elina Kouthoofd, who is the project manager at Skansen, says that the idea of ​​a winter wedding was sparked by the desire to create something new based on the popular summer concept.  - We run drop-in weddings in the summer and have done so for ten years. So we saw before 2026 that Valentine's Day was on a Saturday. Then we thought: Shouldn't we test the drop-in concept, but in the winter? Then there was a winter wedding on February 14, she says.  The atmosphere during Valentine's Day at Skansen is described as magical and filled with love.  - So much love in the air and in every place. It's magical, says Elina Kouthoofd.  In Seglora church from the 18th century, Tina Aandalen and Karl Aspengren got married. With around fifty guests, a priest and lively music, the couple exchanged rings in the historic building. However, the courtship took place just under two months ago.  - Karl proposed on the morning of Christmas Eve. We felt: Now we're driving! Yet we have waited over ten years for it to happen.

Malmer Stenergard points out that the more conciliatory tone from the US will not necessarily last over time. - Rubio extended a hand and said that you want to cooperate with Europe, you want things to go well for Europe. But the collaboration must take place where it is good for us. - In the conversations I have had with him, it has always been very constructive. However, other representatives have sounded different. We all remember the speech in Munich last year and Trump's statements about Greenland Focus on \"white Europe\" Dag Blanck, senior professor of North American studies at Uppsala University, believes that Rubio's speech is strongly influenced by American domestic politics. - This is a speech that speaks to Trump's core voters to a great extent, says Blanck.  He points out that minority groups such as African Americans, Latinos, Asians and indigenous peoples are completely excluded in Rubio's picture of Europe. According to Blanck, Rubio's message was a clear nationalist vision: - He criticized immigration and advocated a Europe that strengthens itself rather than driving global cooperation. He mentioned his roots in Spain and Italy, but not Cuba, and barely spoke at all about democracy or human rights. The focus was instead on Western European culture as a basis for cooperation, says Blanck. - You can say that it is a very narrow view of Europe, where it is defined as \"white Europe\", and where other groups are excluded from the picture. There is a clear connection to domestic politics in the United States.  Independence in focus European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called Rubio's speech \"very reassuring\", but pointed out that other representatives in the administration have a tougher tone. - Europe has no other choice but to become independent.

He therefore has to walk along the E12 – where the cars drive at 90 kilometers per hour.  - It's scary. When trucks come, I feel like I'm going to be run over, he says.  The parents Johanna and Krister have appealed the decision to the administrative court, which assesses the stretch as dangerous for traffic. Even so, Hjalmar is not entitled to a taxi because they live too close to the pick-up point.  - We want the children to be treated fairly and here their safety is not taken into account, says Hjalmar's mother Johanna Sundin.  Getting help from a private actor Previously, they went into the forest to avoid the road, but now a private actor has offered to pick up Hjalmar for free. The family has been told by the municipality that the school bus would cost SEK 250,000 a year, but they consider that to be irrelevant to the discussion.  - I, who work in healthcare, know that you don't say \"now it costs 300,000 for us to replace your hip\", says Johanna Sundin. The parents have lived in Forsmark for 17 years. The municipality is now working to attract more people to the area, but the family believes that it is difficult to motivate other families with children to move there. - You don't want to say: \"come and live here in Forsmark, but your child will have to follow a European path\", says Hjalmar's father Krister Näslund. Parental responsibility applies to the Chairman of the Municipal Board in Storuman municipality, Ulrik Dahlgren (S), says that the decision rests with civil servants and administrative law. He is familiar with the route and admits that there are risks with the proximity to the road.   - This is a road that we all drive many times, so you know the route itself. He explains that parental responsibility applies, which means that it is up to the parents to follow Hjalmar to the bus stop. He cannot offer any suggestions for solutions to Hjalmar's school transport and regrets the dissatisfaction. - Yes, we're never happy when someone threatens to move when we take",

Russian authorities have claimed he died of natural causes, but the Russian version is contested. Now a new investigation shows that he was poisoned with epibatidine – an extremely potent poison extracted from the skin of South American poison dart frogs and many times stronger than morphine. The symptoms include paralysis, severe convulsions and respiratory arrest and greatly increased blood pressure. - We have confirmed that a deadly toxin was found in Alexei Navalny's body. \"Only the Russian government had the opportunity, motive and opportunity to use it against him in prison,\" said British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper. Great Britain: Russia despises its citizens The report is presented at a joint press meeting with all five countries' foreign ministers, but also Navalny's widow, during the security conference in Munich.  - That is why we are here today, to shine a spotlight on the Kremlin's barbaric attempts to silence Alexei Navalny. To show that the Russian government shows contempt for its citizens and is prepared to use this deadly poison, says Cooper. According to Sweden's Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard, experts from the five countries have been able to establish that Navalny was poisoned in Russian captivity. - With the help of experts from all five countries, we have established that he was poisoned by epibatidine. Only Russia could administer the poison because he was in captivity. Most likely, it was the FSB that was behind it, she says. Navalny's widow: No longer just words The investigation will now be handed over to the OPCW, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, to increase pressure on Russia. - We will hold Russia accountable in the OPCW and spread knowledge about the use of this highly potent poison to prevent its use again, says Malmer Stenergard.

  "81f8b7180524c423aa529b26750e13d8b44c8c7a": "On Friday, the security conference began in Munich, with several world leaders in attendance. Ahead of this year's conference, the organizers have chosen to highlight the \"elephant in the room\", namely how the US's role in the world is changing and how well-established collaborations are threatened. Last year, US Vice President JD Vance shocked when he gave his speech with a harsh tone towards Europe. This year, the tone was considerably more accommodating. During Saturday's speech, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized that Europe and the US belong together and highlighted the importance of common security. But the new security situation has caused the Nordic countries to act. - One way to strengthen our security is to merge military units on the northern flank, says Magnus Christiansson, senior lecturer in military science at the University of Defense. - The idea is to send a signal to Russia: you cannot divide us. If a war breaks out on the northern flank, we are already united from the start. Getting more intense – because of the USA Christiansson explains that the Nordic countries are thinking about what other complements they can have to their NATO membership and how they can use it to strengthen their security regionally. This as a result of the US's changed policy and with the threats against Denmark - It is a process that has existed before but is now entering a more intensive stage, he says. The Nordic defense cooperation is today based on the Nordic Defense Cooperation, Nordefco, which means various cooperations that have existed with roots going back to the Cold War. In 2024, the Nordic countries signed an agreement on a joint defense concept – something that can now be intensified. Different experiences One challenge is the different historical experiences of the Nordic countries. - What is a lie in Copenhagen is the truth in Helsinki and that poses a problem. If Russia were to make a push, it would be viewed in completely different ways in the Nordic countries, says Christiansson. - But at the same time, I think this is being done to deter Russia and that is probably one of them",

At the same time, the annual security conference is taking place in Munich, where the exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi is calling for global demonstrations against the regime on Saturday, focusing on the big cities of Munich, Los Angeles and Toronto. \"Iranians abroad and freedom-loving people around the world, February 14 is the global day of action in solidarity with Iran's Sun and Lion Revolution, a day to take to the streets and force the international community to take urgent, practical measures in support of the Iranian people,\" he wrote in a post on X. Exile Iranians from around the world, including Sweden, are now joining the demonstration. Several buses have departed from Gothenburg, Malmö and Stockholm to the giant demonstration that is expected in Munich.  Want to show unity On board one of the buses from Malmö is the Swedish-Iranian Fariba Boustanchi, who traveled for over 14 hours to be the voice of the Iranian people. - The Iranian regime has systematically violated human rights, imprisoned and executed political opponents and suppressed women for several decades. Due to the ongoing and serious situation in Iran, we have gathered here to be the voice of the Iranian people, she says on board the bus on the way to Munich. - We must show the outside world that we agree with each other both outside and inside Iran. We want to draw the world's attention to Iran, she continues. Fariba is one of many Iranians who hope for regime change in Iran. She calls for international support and expresses support for former Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi. - Iranians have expressed very clearly for several years that the Iranian regime is not our representative and that they do not want the mullahs as leaders in Iran. - We demand international recognition of the crown prince as a legitimate representative of Iran.

  "964ca04ff4f7dd3b30a19b9f9a8b1273c7c48c5b": "This year, Saturday does not give the same extra boost as when Valentine's Day falls on a weekday. Saturdays are already popular for restaurant visits, while weekdays usually get a bigger boost from the holiday. \n \nMost of the reservations for the restaurants on Valentine's Day are for two people, but since it is Saturday, larger groups can also show up, which sometimes affects the intimate atmosphere. \n  \n- It can be very intimate and the sound level can be a little lower. But we in the staff usually make sure that everyone feels comfortable and can talk. We joke and sing. It will be nice for everyone here, says Felicia Bonaccorso. Many restaurants fully booked Bonaccorso has been fully booked for several months before Valentine's Day. According to BokaBord, which made a compilation of reservations from 440 restaurants in Stockholm, nearly 70 percent are fully booked during dinner time on Valentine's Day. The booking situation is roughly the same as last year, with an increase of just under two percent. \n  \n- When I was inside myself looking for a free table for two on BokaBord, I saw that there are only 129 restaurants that have a free table tomorrow, compared to 400 restaurants in Stockholm on a normal Saturday, says Peder Dinkelspiel, founder of BokaBord.  Strained financial situation Despite the fact that the booking situation is good, many restaurants continue to have a tough time financially. Many are struggling to repay tax deferrals from the pandemic and guests are spending less than before. \n  \n- The booking situation looks good and it is true. But the notes are smaller.

  "eca31a271892de78316ca12411fa4c04ba9439dc": "According to Rädda Barnen, it is unlikely that the legislators intended that newborn children should be able to be deported when their parents have the right to stay in Sweden. In Emanuel's case, the decision is based on the fact that the rules for so-called track change were changed shortly before his birth - without transitional provisions for families who were already in the country. - I am convinced that no legislator imagined that this could be the consequence. But when many major changes are implemented in a short time, no one has time to review the consequences, says children's rights lawyer Karin Sjömilla. The Prime Minister: \"Sounds unreasonable\" Several leading politicians have reacted to the case. Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson has called the data \"unreasonable\". Even Ebba Busch has described the situation as unreasonable, and Jimmie Åkesson has said that he does not believe there is legal support for deporting an eight-month-old baby. Recently, several high-profile cases have involved children and teenagers who are at risk of deportation. Among other things, the discussion has been about possible exceptions for certain groups, such as so-called high school youth. But point efforts are not enough, says Karin Sjömilla. Save the Children instead calls for a broad review of the legislation at its core, to ensure that the best interests of the child actually have an impact. \"The best interests of the child must be put aside\" Among other things, the possibility to grant a residence permit due to \"particularly painful circumstances\" has been removed and replaced with the significantly more restrictive requirement \"particularly painful reasons\", something which has had major consequences according to Karin Sjömilla. - It is a very strict limitation. At the same time, politics sends the signal that as few as possible should be allowed to stay. This leads to the rules being interpreted narrowly, and then the best interests of the child often have to take a backseat to the principle of regulated immigration, she says. According to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the best interests of the child must be a fundamental starting point in all decisions concerning children. But in practice, that principle does not have enough impact, says Karin Sjömil",

I will never be able to do this, I thought. He didn't get in with the car and had to get in through a small crack.  - I barely got through the door. Took help via Facebook Leo is wary of physical exertion due to heart problems and therefore took help via the Facebook group Anslagstavlan Österlen. Shortly afterwards, an ambulance rolled into the lot. - I thought it was Särbo who had called as a precaution. But it wasn't like that. It turned out that the ambulance nurses Annette Lindelöf and David Sunesson had seen Leo's appeal and since they had time to spare – they rushed out to help. - They jumped out of the car and said \"Hurry up, give us each a shovel\" and then they started bouncing like two snow blowers, says Leo Selmerhagen.  \"Shows empathy\" Since the paramedics were nearby, there was no hesitation in going there.  - For us, it was obvious to help.

  "83836fa6f8cac76367545deb94cc39232188587b": "This ski season, there have been several serious incidents at the Swedish mountain destinations. \nIn December, a 20-year-old man died in one of the ski slopes in Åre, and at the beginning of January, a 45-year-old man died in Björnrike in Vemdalen. What caused the fatal accidents is currently being investigated, but the events have shed light on the state of safety on the slopes at the ski resorts. \n\nIn Lofsdalen there have been no serious incidents this winter, but there have been some incidents where skiers have injured themselves on the slopes.  - There have been a few knee injuries and wrist injuries. says Jonny Larsson, site manager in Lofsdalen.\n\n How do you work to make the slopes as safe as possible? \n\n- We put nets and mattresses on obstacles so the skiers don't injure themselves, and we inform them that we have low-speed zones through signs on the slopes, says Jonny Larsson, site manager in Lofsdalen. Many have been injured on the slopes When TV4 talks to holidaymakers on the ski slope, several of them say that they have at some point injured themselves on the ski slope or have friends or relatives who have been affected. - My daughter was riding and was inattentive and destroyed her knee, not that it broke completely, but got a stretch on both ligaments and cruciate ligaments, says Anders Börjesson. But there are things to keep in mind to reduce the risk of injury on the ski slopes. For example, using a helmet and other protection, having the right settings on your ski bindings, adjusting your speed and training your core and leg strength before you go on a skiing holiday. - I think a bit like this: No one goes to a cross-country competition without training first. The same should apply to downhill skiing. That you have trained your muscles a little before you go to the mountains and go slaloming or snowboarding for a whole week, says ski instructor Stella Elm.",

  "9a5d85a0a3681a613accc1b96f37a3eeb36d4e06": "The last time \"The spin duo\" tried to break a new world record, they failed after just over 13 hours of playing. In the past, those who have stood the longest have stood for 15 hours and 49 minutes, but now the goal is to play for an entire day without dropping the ball. The current world record of 16 hours and 2 seconds was set by two people in the Netherlands.   Practical challenges Playing table tennis for 24 hours requires some preparation. Fredrik Nilsson says that this time they have a special plan for toilet visits. - We will run with the classic adult diaper this time. We can't pee ourselves in live broadcast, he says in Efter fem. - Even if you have Northern Europe's best bladder, you have to drive 24 hours, so better to be safe than sorry, adds Emil Ohlsson. But it is only number one that is relevant, the duo underlines. - Nothing else comes up, says Fredrik Nilsson. \"It will be too boring\" The player duo tells us that there will be officials on site in Västerås. During the record attempt, they will receive viewer questions and talk a lot, something that will be important to keep the concentration up.   - If we hadn't talked to the audience, we would never have managed to set a world record. It will be too boring, simply, to stand with Emil for 24 hours, says Fredrik Nilsson. - Even though we are damn good friends, we get tired of each other too, says Emil Ohlsson. \"Will drive straight into the tile\" The duo are determined to play for 24 hours and in doing so also beat the current record of 16 hours and two seconds.  - We have to take that away from them, says Fredrik.  - That is priority one, but then we will drive straight into the tile, concludes Emil.",

  "523c376baed9a78908a329341fb1ced9029184c5": "This year's winter has been a cold story. For several weeks the temperature has been well below zero. The chilly weather is expected to last. And during Saturday, even lower temperatures are expected, down to minus 37-40 in Gielas, in the Västerbottenfjällen.\n\n- The cold air is already about to swing in from the northeast, because the high pressure is strengthening and taking the cold air with it to the south, says Ulrika Elvgren, TV4 meteorologist. Colder January for a long time January has been colder than normal throughout the country. In Pajala the coldest since the measurements started in 1940. In Karesuando the coldest since 1893. In many places in the Tornedalen January has been among the three coldest that have been measured. \n\n- The coldest so far this year has been minus 40.8 degrees in Gielas on January 4. And here it can be down to 40 degrees this weekend. Last year's lowest temperature in the country was minus 36 degrees, says Ulrika Elvgren. High pressure over Sweden has been blocked The fact that the cold has kept Sweden in a firm grip for so long is because a high pressure over Scandinavia has been blocked. In summer the high pressure causes heat waves, in winter they cause the cold to linger.\n\n- We have had high pressure since January, and right now there is nothing that breaks it down. It's because we don't have any jet streams here, they go by the Mediterranean Sea, where they cause storm Nils, among other things, says Ulrika Elvgren.\n\nAccording to researchers, the fact that the jet streams have lost power is due to the climate changes affecting the Earth's polar regions.\n\n- The jet streams that run in a north-south direction have lost their sting, which allows the cold air to get from the polar regions and south. We would need traction from jet streams to bring up some heat from the south, says Ulrika Elvgren. Chilly for the rest of the month But right now there are no such signs. The cold will last, shows SMHI's long-term forecast. \n\n- It will probably be cold for the rest of the month. And in March, you don't yet see that the jet streams change to any great degree. We have a real winter this year, says Ulrika Elvgren.\n\nBut to last",

In London, fans from all over Europe gather to participate, watch the competitions and meet like-minded people. - Those I have spoken to so far, they say they have been waiting for this for a long period, says Thomas Kvarnkullen, foreign reporter. \"Followed all my life\" Amar Palm is a pokemon enthusiast and has tens of thousands of cards in his collection.  - When I was little, I opened packs with my mother. I have always been a big collector. Pokemon is the only thing that has accompanied me all my life, says Amar Palm in Efter fem. Several of Amar's cards are very valuable. One of his most exclusive cards, a so-called Bubble Mew, can be worth up to SEK 30,000. However, selling the cards is not an option. - I get separation anxiety just from the thought of selling the cards, says Amor Palm. Millions for rare cards The Pokemon trend is not only felt among fans - it is also clearly visible in the market. A unique Pokémon card is currently for sale for over 5 million dollars, equivalent to just over 50 million kroner. The value of the card is due to its unique history and condition and it has never been available in regular packs. - Combined with the fact that you couldn't open it in any pack plus it being a ten makes it the most desirable card in all of Pokémon, says Amar Palm.",

  "efd290df07fed2fa1fcd561d62dbc2d4f5401711": "On Friday, Katja Nyberg took part in the newspaper Kvartal's Friday interview. In the podcast, she says that the Swedish Transport Agency revoked her driver's license because they found a metabolite of cocaine, i.e. a chemical residue, and that it is \"not an active substance\". - Then the question is how it got into my body, says Nyberg. When asked how the residual product could have arisen, she replies: - I have not taken any cocaine. I deny wrongdoing. Nyberg's lawyer has previously used a similar argument. \"For an unknown reason, a rapid test gave a result for cocaine, but only for the metabolite and not the narcotic substance,\" the lawyer wrote in a letter to the Swedish Transport Agency, which TV4 previously reported on. Swedish Medical Examiner's Office: Can only occur if you take cocaine Jimmy Blomqvist Larsson, press officer at the Swedish Medical Examiner's Office, dismisses the reasoning completely. Benzoylecgonine, i.e. the residual product you measure to see if someone has taken cocaine, is classified as a narcotic in itself. If you test positive for that, you are automatically guilty of a drug crime, even if it is not the active substance, he says. In addition, he says that if the metabolite is present in the blood, it always means that you have taken cocaine. - If you've had it in your body, you've had cocaine in your body, says Jimmy Blomqvist Larsson. If benzoylecgonine is found in the body, can it be equated with having used cocaine? - Yes. Could this metabolite occur in some other way than if you took cocaine? - No. Became a political wild It was in the intervening days that Katja Nyberg was stopped by the police after a game accident. The police found a bag of white powder, and she has since been investigated for drunk driving and drug offences. At the end of January, the Swedish Transport Agency revoked her driver's license after drugs were detected in the test results. She has been dismissed from several heavy assignments and became a political wild after the scandal. Katja Nyberg has previously worked as a police officer and was the Sweden Democrats' spokesperson on police issues. During",

According to information to TV4 Nyheterna, the suspect is a principal at a school. The victim, who is a minor, has previously been a student at the same school. The criminal suspicions against the principal are said to have strengthened during the day. - Last night the person was arrested on reasonable suspicion (the lower level of suspicion) and now I have just made the decision that the arrest remains but now on probable grounds, the higher level of suspicion. We have gone through more evidence and the person is heard with his defender, says the prosecutor. Denies crime The suspected sexual crimes must have taken place for about a year and a half, according to the prosecutor. - I cannot comment on how many cases are involved, but there are several cases of rape and it must have taken place during a period from the summer of 2024 to the beginning of this year. The prosecutor confirms that the suspected perpetrator is employed at a school, but does not want to comment on TV4 Nyheter's information that he works as a principal. - The arrested person denies the crime. Now the investigation continues. We will hold further interrogations and carry out technical investigations and a review of technical seizures. TV4 Nyheterna has contacted the relevant municipality for a comment. By Sunday at the latest, the prosecutor must request the rector's arrest. The lawyer does not want to comment.",

  "0d456ad81dd4a0dad049e3fe425ea57c0bf3142e": "More cases of winter sickness are now being reported in Sweden. The number is expected to continue to increase, according to the Public Health Authority.   - It is quite likely that the peak has not been reached, but it is difficult to know. The vast majority do not seek care for the symptoms and then not everyone is included in the statistics, says Acting State Epidemiologist Erik Sturegård. The winter sickness is caused by calicivirus which is highly contagious and resistant. Hand sanitizer is not enough and it takes a very small amount of the virus to make you sick. - It can also withstand dehydration, which means that you can become infected long after you have come into contact with it.  Easy to confuse with food poisoning Erik Sturegård believes that mouth protection is only recommended if you are exposed to large amounts of viruses, such as in healthcare. A common mistake is to mistake winter sickness for food poisoning. - There are similar symptoms, but with food poisoning you get sick right away and then quickly get well again. But it can be difficult to know, and therefore one should not take chances but assume that it is winter sickness.  The risk of infection is particularly high for families with small children and specifically when cooking. - If you get sick, it is very important that you do not cook for others. If you have sick children, it is important that they stay at home for at least 48 hours after the last bout of vomiting and diarrhoea. More cases than last year The latest increase in cases is in line with the Public Health Agency's forecast. At the moment, the numbers are higher than compared to last year and it is difficult to say when the spread can conceivably slow down.  - It is possible to work to bring the numbers down if we are meticulous about hygiene. The spread usually takes place over a relatively long period and it is greatly influenced by the efforts we make.",
