However, it is clear that the Epstein scandal has now reached Starmer's absolute closeness, which means that other politics end up in the background.\n\nAnyone who follows British politics is used to loud headlines, fierce debates in the House of Commons and frequent ministerial changes. Now, however, everything revolves around the question of what the Prime Minister actually knew when Mandelson was appointed to the prestigious ambassador post in Washington.  In the House of Commons yesterday, Starmer admitted he was aware of Mandelson's contacts with Epstein after the 2008 conviction. But during the pre-appointment security clearance, Mandelson claimed he barely knew Epstein - a lie that led to his sacking over a dawn phone call on the US east coast last September.  Demands for publication In the House of Commons, demands are now growing to publish the documents that show how Mandelson was investigated before his appointment. Starmer supports the demand, but the police - who have opened a preliminary investigation against Mandelson - have stopped publication for the time being. Frustrating for the Prime Minister, to use his own words from today's press conference.  Starmer assures that he had absolutely no information about the close relationship between Mandelson and Epstein that he has today. Perhaps the Prime Minister of Great Britain should ask himself how the security clearance for one of the heaviest assignments in the foreign administration is done?\n\nDocuments from the US Department of Justice, consisting of both emails and photos, testify to close contacts between Epstein and the British heavyweight.  That Mandelson appears in the picture in old white underpants in Epstein's apartment in Paris is in this context a minor detail; significantly more serious is that he shared market-sensitive information and gave Epstein insight behind the scenes into London's political top echelons, including during the coalition negotiations in 2010.",

According to Jakob Hallgren, director of the Foreign Policy Institute, there is a great risk that a long period of disarmament will now stop – or reverse. - This is the first time since the early 1970s that there is no agreement regulating the number and use of the most powerful nuclear weapons between the two countries that have the most in the entire world, he says. Regulated the most dangerous weapons The agreement that is now expiring has been about limiting strategic nuclear weapons, above all intercontinental missiles that can be fired from the US at Russia - or vice versa. In recent decades, these agreements have led to a sharp reduction in the world's nuclear arsenals. - During these 50 years, they have gone from a maximum of 70,000 nuclear weapons down to 12,000 today. It is a result of successive reductions that are now stopping – or, in the worst case, reversing. According to Hallgren, the risks already exist today. One of the biggest problems is that the US and Russia can no longer agree on new agreements. Today, China is estimated to have around 600 nuclear weapons, but Hallgren points to information which claims that the country may be on its way to 1,000 or 1,500. - China is now the factor that makes it impossible to come to an agreement. The US has said it wants China on board, but the Chinese say no. Increased tensions - also in Europe When there is no agreement that regulates the most devastating nuclear weapons, tensions in the outside world also increase, says Hallgren. The expert emphasizes that even a limited use of nuclear weapons would have extreme consequences. - Even the smallest nuclear weapon would have completely devastating effects, with hundreds of thousands - if not millions - of people injured or killed. There are terrible effects of nuclear weapons. At the same time, there is still the so-called non-proliferation agreement, which came into force at the end of the 1960s and aims",

But the funding itself must still come from the countries' own, often already strained budgets. From Berlin to Dresden by high-speed train In the south of Berlin, a new railway line shines in the sun. Double tracks, high noise barriers and a nail-straight stretch to the south. It is Germany's newest high-speed line, which opened at the beginning of December 2025 and makes the journey between Berlin and Dresden ten minutes faster. The project took 20 years to plan and seven years to build – but without any delays. The next step is to extend the route to the Czech capital Prague. Then the travel time between Berlin and Prague will be reduced to two and a half hours, compared to almost five hours today. Such a project is exactly what the European Commission wants the member states to invest in. Underinvestment, cheap tickets and short-term thinking But according to Christian Böttger, it will take years before a similar project can be inaugurated in Germany – or in Europe as a whole. According to him, billions are missing to even renovate the existing railway. The funds that do exist are often used for short-term solutions or for politically popular measures, such as lowering the price of train tickets. In Germany, years of underinvestment are clearly visible. Only about 62 percent of the trains run on time. Sweden is average within the EU, but still manages better, with around 87 percent on time. - In such a situation, to believe that new high-speed lines will be built within 15 years is wishful thinking, he says.",

  "d39132ccb5849bd8b9e5720520d6590fbfc7245e": "Thursday evening and Friday can be messy in parts of Skåne. Previously, an orange warning for snowfall combined with wind has been issued for south-eastern Skåne, and in the southern and central parts of the county a yellow warning has been issued for similar weather conditions. The warnings apply from five o'clock on Thursday afternoon and extend until two o'clock on Friday afternoon. - In the south-eastern parts, there may be upwards of 20 centimeters of snow, locally more. There will also be a fresh to strong easterly wind - and then you know there will be snowdrifts in Österlen, says TV4 Nyhetern's meteorologist Peter Kondrup. \"Bare ground to half a meter of snow in no time\" Drift formation is a recurring problem in the open landscapes of Scania. Despite a snowfall of around 20 centimetres, the snow depth can vary significantly, which can affect both major and minor roads. - If you've ever been to Skåne, you know that it can go from bare ground to half a meter of snow in no time. There is nothing to stop the snow, but it drifts from one place to another and unfortunately often accumulates on the road. The advice is not to go out in traffic if you really don't have to, says Peter Kondrup. The last time there was an orange warning in approximately the same area in south-eastern Scania, a large part of the forecast was missed. - There were not as large quantities as feared and therefore there were not as many problems as had been expected. However, it remains to be seen how it will turn out this time – forecasts are forecasts, says Peter Kondrup. Risk of ice slippage Along the Öresund coast in the west, mild air will move in from the south, which can lead to freezing rain and ice slippage. - So it can be really noisy in Skåne tomorrow, with drifting snow in Österlen and risk of icy conditions in the west. In addition to Skåne, SMHI has issued a yellow warning for snowfall in parts of Halland and Västra Götaland counties. The warning applies from six o'clock on Friday morning and extends from just north of Varberg up to Trollhättan. During Friday, the weather moves north and in the West",

  "bb1fe796044e846e372c041cee147d3ccd82b4ec": "The National Board of Health and Welfare has gone through 98 cases where children and adults in the years 2019 to 2024 have been killed or subjected to serious violence. Among these there are 41 cases involving children and in half of those cases it is the child's own parent who exposed them to the violence. Is it a failure? - You have to say that. When we have gone through these 98 cases, they are cases that have fallen between society's safety nets and then suffered fatal violence, have been murdered or serious violence, says Björn Eriksson in Nyhetsmorgon. Difficult to put together the puzzle The survey adds to previous reports on intimate partner violence to identify where society is failing. - We know what the risk factors are. Often there has been contact with the health and medical services. The police have been aware of them and social services have been aware. But it has been difficult to piece together this complex picture as it has been. That is what has broken, says Björn Eriksson. The National Board of Health and Welfare points out that these are unusual, but very serious crimes. - The vast majority of parents do not harm their children and the vast majority of women are not killed by a partner. But every case is so serious. We have an obligation to better prevent, says Moa Mannheimer, licensed psychologist and investigator at the National Board of Health and Welfare. Must listen more to the children The authority has several proposals for measures that must be presented to the government. An important part is more collaboration. - We can see in retrospect that the police had certain duties, the social service had certain duties and the health care service others. But putting the puzzle together and assessing risks in a structured way - that has been missing in these cases, says Moa Mannheimer. Another measure identified is that the child's situation must be strengthened. - You need to listen more to the children's voice both within healthcare, the police and social services. We need to take steps forward and not always just listen to the parents' version, but also take in the whole, says Björn Eriksson.",

  "ac38a9d07d9b6a5d78a4425981f9df7e21faf9be": "A week and a half ago, Djurens vänner in Staffanstorp in Scania received an emergency call from a family who could no longer care for the 30 guinea pigs they had at the time. Actually, the animal shelter did not have room for more animals, but still chose to move in. - We still felt that the situation was so big. The family really needed help, says Linnéa Stålhandske, operational director of Friends of the Animals Skåne.  More guinea pigs than expected When the animal friends arrived at the family in Staffanstorp, they were greeted by more animals than expected – 40 guinea pigs and a turtle. Guinea pigs become fertile as early as three to four weeks of age, which means they can reproduce quickly if kept together.  - Then they often mate with those nearby. If it is then a mother or a sister, it will be inbreeding. To avoid further reproduction, all males have now been neutered. When the guinea pigs were taken into care, fur and claws were left behind. Among the guinea pigs was \"Grandma Rosiepuff\", the oldest guinea pig who is believed to be the mother of many of the others. - She is probably related to all of them. She is the oldest guinea pig we have received, says Linnéa Stålhandske in Nyhetsmorgon.  \"Looking for the perfect homes\" After the case drew attention in social media, the animal shelter has received many expressions of interest. At the same time, care is taken to only place the guinea pig with serious animal owners.  - We do not sell small animals to be kept in cages. We do not sell small animals to be toys for children, of course. So we look for the perfect homes.  Guinea pigs can live between five and ten years if cared for properly. They need large areas to move around, such as a paddock or their own room, and should never be kept alone. They require companionship, a proper diet of fresh vegetables and free access to hay.",

She makes bonnets, jewelery and art objects from reindeer antler, leather and wood for Jokkmokk's market. Despite the fact that e-commerce has grown in importance, the market is still the most important sales opportunity of the year for many Sami artisans. Combining crafts and reindeer herding Julia and many other Sami craftsmen combine crafting with reindeer herding. During the winter, spring and summer, reindeer husbandry takes up most of the time, while autumn is devoted to handicrafts. The work is long-term and already in the spring of the year before, planning begins for next year's market. - Yes, for me it is like that, at the market you sell for the whole year. After all, the market is the target, because it is precisely Sami craftsmanship that you want to see, look at and feel. So you prefer to buy on the spot, it's not something you just order. But you want to see what you get, says Julia Rensberg. Long-term planning for the future The materials, reindeer antler, hide and wood, for the craft often have to dry for one to two years in order not to crack and break during the crafting itself, which requires careful planning. Julia Rensberg emphasizes the importance of being careful with both materials and resources to secure the opportunities of future generations. - The material should ideally dry for one to two years, so this spring I started thinking about the market that will come in 2027. It takes time and you have to be careful both with materials and resources and think far ahead and also make sure that there is material left for future generations, says Julia Rensberg.",

Police in Arizona suspect she has been abducted from her home outside of Tucson and are investigating the incident as a crime. Nancy Guthrie was last seen late Saturday night, January 31, when she returned home to her residence. When she didn't show up at church the following morning, friends and family raised the alarm, and she was reported missing at lunchtime on Sunday. Demanding ransom US media have reported signs of a break-in and traces of blood in the home. However, authorities have been tight-lipped on details and have not publicly confirmed exactly what was found, citing the ongoing investigation. The incident has gained further attention after several media outlets, including TMZ, reported receiving messages demanding a ransom for Nancy Guthrie's release.  The police have not yet confirmed that the claims come from an actual perpetrator – but have not dismissed them either. \"When messages come to us, we treat it like any evidence,\" Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told CBS News. The family's plea Four days after the disappearance, Savannah Guthrie, along with her siblings, posted a video on Instagram in which they directly address the person who may be holding their mother captive. - We are ready to talk. But we live in a world where voices and images can be easily manipulated. We have to be absolutely sure she's alive. And that you have her. We want to hear from you, and we are ready to listen, she says.  She also tells us that her mother lives with constant pain and depends on her medicine to survive.  - Everyone is looking for you, mother, everywhere. We will not rest. Your children will not rest until we are together again, she says.

The government believes that this has led to people convicted of rape in some cases having to stay in Sweden. The government wants rape and other serious sexual crimes to always be considered extremely serious crimes when considering deportation. - Rapists must be able to be deported. It doesn't get any weirder than that, says Migration Minister Johan Forssell (M) to TV4 Nyheterna. Wants to get other countries on board According to Forssell, Sweden is the first to come out with the initiative, but the government hopes to get other countries on board, mainly within the EU and the Nordics. The work is now starting at the UN level and the process may be long, even if movement is hoped for already this year. - Sweden will soon have the toughest regulations in the Nordics for criminal deportations, but it is not enough. We also want to change the international framework, says Forssell. In parallel, the government is expected to present new Swedish legislation this spring, which could lead to more criminal deportations. The individual examination in court must remain, but the government wants rape to always weigh very heavily in the assessment. Dismisses symbolic politics The background is that Swedish courts, with reference to current practice and international conventions, in some cases judged that the crime was not serious enough for deportation. The government therefore wants to influence how the refugee convention is applied, including through changes in UNHCR's governing documents. Forssell dismisses the initiative as symbolic politics, but admits that the process can be both difficult and time-consuming. - This is work that has not been touched on for a very long time, he says.",

This is shown in a research report from AgriFood Economics, which is a collaboration between the Swedish University of Agriculture and Lund University. If the dietary change persists, it can make us sicker. \n\n- The fact that we reduce the intake of fruit and vegetables and also dietary fibre, has had a negative effect on public health. Above all, cardiovascular diseases could increase if we continued to eat this way over time, says Jonas Nordström, who is associate professor of economics and one of the report's authors.  Does not buy fresh fish Eva Ahlgren from Malmö shops with her husband and grandchildren at Ica Mathuset in Åkarp, Scania. She notes that they never bought very much fruit and vegetables, because the husband is not that fond of vegetables, but they buy less fish today than before the price increases.\n\n- Maybe frozen fish in that case. Fresh is very expensive, she says. \n\nLars Håhus, who is a regular customer in the store, belongs to those who have not changed their purchasing habits at all in recent years.\n\n- I'm as stingy as I've always been and buy what I want and what's the best price, he says with a smile.  Hitting low-income earners Jonas Nordström and his research colleagues at AgriFood Economics could also see that it was the cheapest goods that received the highest percentage price increases. A phenomenon known as \"cheapflation\".\n\n- It is often households with fairly small margins who choose the cheap products. In this way, it can be said that cheapflation and the inflation we have had have affected low-income households to a greater extent, notes Jonas Nordström.

This also applies to parts of the plot that belong to Bengt's hotel. - I thought: What on earth? It wasn't destroyed yesterday, but it happened this morning. I've never seen anything like it. - And it continues to blow. So it's great weather. Bengt Lundblad and the family also celebrated his 74th birthday at the same place. - Then we had sunshine and there were sunbeds and laps of sun. So there are tremendous contrasts. \"People stay inside\" When asked what the atmosphere is like in the village, the birthday boy replies that he doesn't know. - There aren't that many people out, so we don't meet that many. They stay inside, people down here. After all, they also warned us - we shouldn't go out, they said. But Bengt Lundblad does not feel particularly worried about himself. - We have a good hotel that stands firm, he says and continues: - You have to stay away from the sea. Now we are actually sitting in a restaurant by the sea. But it's on solid ground so it won't fall down. On Friday, the storm will subside and Bengt Lundblad and his family will remain in Calahonda next week as well. - So we hope for a few sunny days.",

The talks were confirmed by both sides late Wednesday after some uncertainty about the time and place. Focus on the nuclear program The US delegation wants to investigate \"zero nuclear weapons capability\" for Iran, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, who emphasizes that Trump has \"many options at his disposal beyond diplomacy\", reports AFP. The talks come shortly after widespread protests in Iran, where human rights groups report tens of thousands dead after heavy crackdowns.\n\n- They are negotiating, Trump says of Iran.\n\n- They don't want us to attack them, we have a large fleet heading there, he adds, referring to the group of aircraft carriers he called an \"armada\".\n\nVice President JD Vance says Trump \"will talk to everybody, he will try to accomplish what he can through non-military means and if he feels the military is the only option, he will ultimately choose it.\" Regional concerns and diplomatic hopes German Chancellor Friedrich Merz calls on Iran's leadership to \"really start talks\" and warns of \"great fear of military escalation in the region\". Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says that \"the parties want to give room for diplomacy\" and that conflict \"was not the solution\".\n\nAccording to the New York Times, the US has agreed to exclude regional actors from the talks, but missile and militia issues can still be discussed.  The Institute for the Study of War states that \"Iran continues to show inflexibility in meeting US demands, reducing the likelihood that Iran and the US will be able to reach a diplomatic solution\".\n\nIran has warned to strike back against US bases if attacked. \n\n- We are ready to defend ourselves and it is the President of the United States who must choose between compromise or war, said General Mohammad Akraminia.",

  "929f7723a7490779b6801a57d839f22b8a0f66d7": "It was a couple of years ago that Dumpen confronted a man who they believed had sex-chatted with a 14-year-old. After being hanged, the man stated that he felt unwell and was unable to work, which led him to sue Dumpen's responsible publisher for gross defamation. - This one is perhaps particularly interesting because Dumpen is very much noticed in society. It poses very big questions at its tip that arouse a lot of emotions, says Ängla Pändel, lawyer and expert on defamation issues. \"Quite unique for Sweden\" According to a jury, which is used in this type of case, she is guilty. But now the judge must also take a position on the issue and announce the verdict today. In this case, Dumpen can be convicted of defamation regardless of whether the man was guilty of the sex chats or not. - It is quite unique for Sweden that the defamation provision also covers information that is true. But on the other hand, you carry out a type of justifiability assessment, so in some cases it can still be justifiable to spread this type of information if you can show that the public interest outweighs the individual's right to privacy and protection of personal integrity, explains Ängla Pändel.",

He has also served as secretary general of the Council of Europe and as chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee.  Now Norway's ecocrime authority has decided to investigate him, following suspicions that he was guilty of ecocrime in his contacts with Jeffrey Epstein. - We have decided to start an investigation against Thorbjørn Jagland, says Pål K. Lønseth, head of the Norwegian Ecocrime Authority, to NRK. More specifically, they are investigating whether Jagland received gifts, trips and loans while he was chairman of the Nobel Committee and secretary general of the Council of Europe. Want to waive immunity There is, however, an aggravating circumstance. Jagland has immunity for his former role in the Council of Europe. The ecocrime authority now wants the Norwegian Foreign Ministry to lift that immunity, reports Dagbladet. \"Because Jagland has immunity as the former head of an international organization, Ekokrim has asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to take the initiative to lift the immunity,\" the authority writes in a press release. Norway's Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide agrees with the Ecocrime Authority that Jagland's immunity must be lifted. - It is important that this issue is clarified. Then Jagland's immunity cannot stand in the way of an investigation. I have therefore decided that Norway should present a proposal to the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers that Jagland's immunity should be lifted, says the foreign minister. Taking the investigation in stride Thorbjørn Jagland's defense lawyer, Anders Brosveet, however, takes the accusations against his client in stride. He tells VG that they will cooperate with the investigation and submit the requested documentation. - And based on what we have found, we are calmly looking at the outcome. It is first and foremost good for Jagland to get an authoritative clarification from Ekokrim, rather than the entire press corps carrying out its own little private investigation, says Brosveet.  Emails in the latest Epstein files show, among other things",

  "720d18b9711156d13bfeba8e583fd3d856114b87": "According to an American study, one in four singles in the United States, and almost half of Generation Z, use AI to, among other things, analyze messages when dating online. One of those who use AI as a springboard in their dating is Dilara Chakali. - When I went to therapy, I felt: One hour a week was not enough for me. I wanted to reflect more. I wanted to understand myself more, how I function in dating, says Dilara Chakali in Efter fem. \"Not so strange\" Dilara Chakali says that she uses AI to get straight answers, but emphasizes that it is she herself who decides which advice she takes to heart. - I want \"the ugly truth\", she says.  - Then of course I choose how I act on it. I want to believe that I have the self-awareness that I don't act on everything it says, she says. Psychologist Maria Farm believes that it is a natural human behavior to ask for advice. And in this way, it is understandable that more and more people are using AI in these matters. - I think it is a natural consequence. That it is there and that we also use it in psychological matters, I don't think that is so strange in itself, says Maria Farm in Efter fem. The psychologist's advice: See it as a supplement Farm sees no major problems with using AI as support, but urges you to ask yourself the question for what purpose you are asking a question, as it can become destructive in the long run if you constantly have to ask and cannot make decisions yourself. - I have many clients who are a bit anxious, full of anxiety and they sometimes need to practice not actually asking so many questions about it, it could be the relationship, but it could also be their own health.  - With me, they get to practice standing up for their own opinion or maybe not asking for completely certain answers all the time, adds Farm. Maria Farm recommends that AI be used as part of a larger palette when it comes to big decisions in life. - If you are thinking about something as big as divorce, also ask a person. It doesn't have to be a therapist, but some wise person you trust",

  "a9cff08032cb77552a536a8a010fcb00023732c4": "Since the middle of January, a high pressure has settled over Sweden. Especially high pressure and freezing temperatures go hand in hand during the winter months, not least when it becomes prolonged.  In meteorology, such a locked-in high pressure is called a high-pressure blockage, and is what lays the foundation for weather extremes. - Blocking high pressure creates winter's cold snaps and summer's heat waves, explains TV4 meteorologist Ulrika Elvgren. Therefore the cold remains The reason why the high pressure has become permanent is partly that it consists of slowly sinking air, that is to say that it receives its air supply from above. The cold air is also heavier than the warm, and air accumulation (high pressure) therefore thrives in the atmosphere closest to the ground. In order to break the high-pressure bucket, an extensive low pressure with a substantial portion of mild air is therefore required.  But during periods of high pressure blocking, the low pressure is instead guided around the high pressure and the cold, as now, is allowed to remain undisturbed.  - It's a locked-in weather situation and we've had this high pressure now for several weeks, but it might start to weaken a little during the next week and let in a little more weakened frontal zones, says Ulrika Elvgren. - We have already received a little more snow in southern Sweden. But it looks like the cold air won't let go. A cold domain lies over the whole of northern Europe and into the Russian continent and further east, she adds. \"No clear mild air coming in\" Although the high pressure may change at the beginning of next week, one should not count on the cold air to disappear because of it. Further ahead, the forecasts are too uncertain to be able to draw any conclusions. - It looks like colder air will return as we approach the middle of February. We have no clear mild air coming in. Maybe sometime in the second half, towards the end of February. But the first half of February still looks very cold, says Ulrika Elvgren. - There is no hope of any spring heat before Valentine's Day. From February 15 starts",

The Jas Gripen is a far better and more cost-effective alternative, it is believed.  The proposal by Saab to sell the Jas Gripen to Canada should be adopted immediately, Opposition Leader Davies said at a press briefing in the Canadian Parliament in Ottawa last night, underlining that the situation is serious. Reduced dependence on the United States The play is done against the background of Canada's decision to expand its air combat forces with 88 new planes. 16 of these, F-35 Lightning from American Lockheed Martin are already booked and ordered. But there is now an intense debate about the remaining 72 combat aircraft; which plan to choose? Concerns about the reliability of the United States as a partner have grown in Canada following Donald Trump's repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state of the United States. The opposition now also points out that Prime Minister Mark Carney himself in his famous speech in Davos recently emphasized that Canada must act more independently and reduce its dependence on the United States and invest more in cooperation with medium-sized countries. \n\n- If Mark Carney completes the purchase of the F-35, it proves that his statements in Davos were just a PR stunt, says Don Davies.

We would see it as a hub for exports, said Mikael Franzén, head of marketing for Saab's Gripen program at the Singapore Airshow yesterday.

In connection with the visit, Åkesson had planned to participate in the traditional reindeer race, but the SD leader needed to think again. According to information to TV4 Nyheterna, Åkesson skips the competition at the request of Säpo. \"Heard it was a revolver\" Several politicians on site have been informed of an \"incident\" by the authority. The party leader tells TV4 Nyheterna that he learned that someone dropped a weapon-like object near him. - I heard that it was a revolver or a pistol, says Jimmie Åkesson. The police write on their website that they have information about a weapon-like object, but that it must have been picked up and that one or more people must have left the scene. The police have not yet found any weapon. At first there were reports that politicians had been threatened, but the police deny this. Säpo denies Säpo's press service does not want to go into whether they warned the SD leader about a firearm. - Our dialogue with our guardians is not something we can go into, so I cannot say anything about it. It is part of the protection itself, says Säpo's spokesperson Johan Wikström. The Sweden Democrats' press department cannot confirm whether Åkesson has received threats. - The information I have is that he is not running, and it is after a recommendation from Säpo, says party spokesperson Emma Kareld. It is not the first time Jimmie Åkesson has had to leave Jokkmokk's market. In 2014, his book signing at the market was stopped due to threats, which SVT Norrbotten reported on at the time.",

Both features are made with reporter Filip Jacobsson. - It is an honor, but it is Filip who should have the credit for the idea for the feature, says Petter Åkerman. Celebrating the aesthetic quality Daniel Zdolsek also highlights reporter Filip Jacobsson. - The fact that we are nominated says something about the fact that we have reporters who care about the aesthetic expression and quality, and that we have been seen so much in recent years. It says something about where the channel stands in terms of quality compared to the competitors - I think we are far ahead of everyone else. It's fun, says Daniel Zdolsek and adds: - TV4 allows you to develop and express yourself aesthetically and visually qualitatively during the work shifts, which I value.",

It comes below the inflation target of two percent, says Frida Bratt.

At the same time, it may take some time before a possible reduction takes place. - Even if the next step could be a reduction, it could take a while.

Pressure against Iran to increase At the same time, Sweden wants to see continued heavy international pressure against the Iranian regime. The government supports new EU sanctions against regime representatives who were involved in the deadly violence against protesters.  Sweden also welcomes that the EU countries have now agreed to list the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as terrorists - a demand that the government has pushed for for a long time with the support of a unanimous Riksdag. - No one can do everything, but everyone can do something. We are at the forefront now in Europe and hope that more countries will follow with similar support, says Dousa.\n\nThe government's announcement comes at the same time as the protests in Iran continue to be met with harsh reprisals from the regime.

Such as whether it is still possible to trust the USA, or possibly it is time for Sweden to build up its own nuclear deterrent. - Not to show the power like the USA, that we have this, and sort of show the shoulders and muscles. But as a defense for a country that has fought for so many years to become the strong Sweden that it is right now, says Marya Osman. - That can be an argument, but at the same time we have allies who have nuclear weapons. So nuclear weapons should deter, and it won't if everyone has them, says Roger Wilhelmsson. Higher support than expected In a survey conducted by Novus with 1,007 respondents, 68 percent recently said no to Sweden acquiring its own nuclear weapons to increase its security. But 17 per cent positive was still higher support than expected, according to the head of research for the FOI's nuclear analysis programme. - People's concerns are expressed in this, and it's not entirely unreasonable. That doesn't mean the doors to everyone are open to anything right now, so to speak. But it is probably a reflection of the fact that we have a challenging security policy situation where people are willing to reconsider previous positions, says Karl Sörenson, head of FOI research. At the same time, new nuclear weapons programs have a high price. According to Sörenson, Europe should primarily deepen cooperation with France's and Great Britain's already existing programs, but primarily continue to build up its conventional defense capabilities. Difficult situation for the USA Sörenson also points out that, despite Trump's actions, the USA continues to guarantee NATO's nuclear deterrent, and preferably does not want to see a too strong Europe there. - The spread effect that would then occur might not only be in Europe but contagion and spread further in the world, it would create a situation that is much more complicated even for the United States to handle, if many countries in the world acquire nuclear weapons. So for the US it is probably in many ways better to have it that way",

During Friday, charges were brought against an activist in the group, suspected of illegal threats and grossly illegal threats. The man denies any wrongdoing.\n\nMunicipal politician Showan Shattak in Malmö has expressed support for the action, which has led to criticism within the Left Party.

Sharp criticism of the party leader Civil Defense Minister Carl-Oskar Bohlin (M) calls Dadgostar's answer \"completely substandard\" and writes on X that she came up with an \"obvious lie\".\n\nWhen Dadgostar left the meeting at the Government Office, TV4 Nyheterna tried to get a comment about the conflict, but she got into one of Säpo's cars and left the scene without answering. \"We have to go on,\" said one of the party's employees, as Dadgostar left the scene.\n\nAfterwards, TV4 Nyheterna sent written questions to the Left Party. The party's press office replies: \"In our party, the party secretary and party districts are responsible for internal dialogue. Beyond that, we have no further comment at this time.\" \"Hiding from the media\" Bohlin continues to direct sharp criticism at Dadgostar: - You can easily get the impression that Nooshi Dadgostar is hiding from the media in this matter and that's enough, but what she is mainly hiding from are large parts of her own party, Bohlin tells TV4 Nyheterna. - Her party association in Sweden's third largest city supports threats and actions against ministers in the government.

In total, there are now close to 30 former patients who have sounded the alarm. Today, some of the women who participated in Kalla fakta's report Barnmakarna were invited to a meeting with Minister of Health Elisabet Lann. - I was incredibly deeply moved by their story. It has played a role that they tell and dare to step forward, says Lann. Unscientific treatment methods Cold facts have revealed, among other things, that Eliva sold unscientific treatment methods and failed to report medical injuries to Lex Maria.  Eliva believes that all their treatments are medically justified, and that no patient has been harmed at their clinic. But today the former patients had to give their picture to the minister. - It felt like she was listening. Our goal is that no woman should have to go through what we did and we really believe that the meeting will have an effect, says one of them, Iris. A health care scandal Health Minister Elisabet Lann calls what happened at Eliva a major health care scandal and during the meeting took up two measures to prevent it from happening again: Firstly, it should be easier for patients to determine which treatment methods are approved by offering them knowledge support. It is a question that is now on the Board of Health and Welfare's table. Elisabet Lann further believes that Kalla fakta's disclosure has also brought up the issue of licensing requirements for private healthcare companies. An investigation into this is ongoing. - This would mean that everyone who is currently a care provider would have to be approved in order to get this permit. It is a way to get rid of unscrupulous actors, she believes. Elisabet Lann reacts strongly to the fact that Eliva has not made a single patient-related Lex Maria report in five years despite repeated serious incidents and care injuries at the clinic. She directs criticism at the supervisory authority IVO - They should do their job and not settle for records that are deficient, but there is obviously documentation here that should",

Several politicians in the municipal board supported the proposal and hope that the initiative will lead to both better health and more residents. But Suzann Larsdotter sees both opportunities and risks. Voluntariness and integrity in focus According to Larsdotter, it can be positive to raise questions about sexual health and intimacy, especially since many couples find it difficult to find time for closeness in everyday life. - In my clinical everyday life, many people find it difficult to find time, so maybe this could make it easier, she says in Efter fem. At the same time, she warns that political initiatives in the area risk becoming normative and putting pressure on residents to have children. - It can become a bit problematic when the municipality somewhere puts pronatalist pressure on the population and somehow urges that it is an obligation to have children, says Suzann Larsdotter. \"A way to get some attention\" Larsdotter believes that the proposal is primarily a way to create debate and visibility ahead of the upcoming election year. - I think this was a way to get some attention to politics. They got quite a lot of media attention through this proposal, she says. She also points out that there are practical and ethical issues to consider, and that employers must protect the privacy of their employees. - It should be about privacy and maybe it shouldn't be personnel policy at work, says Suzann Larsdotter.",

According to information to TV4 Nyheterna, the authority is suspected of covering up nearly 200 possible environmental crimes by not reporting the incidents to the police. The majority of cases are linked to LKAB, SSAB and Boliden Mineral. TV4 Nyheterna has now spoken to employees at the County Administrative Board in Norrbotten. - We have long been very frustrated about this very thing, that you don't file a police report when it comes to environmental crimes. There are several of us who are very critical of how the County Administrative Board handles suspected environmental crimes, says a person at the authority. The suspicions of malfeasance at the County Administrative Board came to light when the police received a report about one of Sweden's largest diesel spills - just over three years after it occurred. In connection with that investigation, the police discovered another 200 unreported suspected environmental crimes. - It should be enough that the County Administrative Board has a suspicion of environmental crime, then a report must be made. Then the police can investigate whether it is or not. We should not sit at the County Board and investigate whether it might be an environmental crime or not. And it takes a long time. In some cases the police report is not submitted, in other cases it has taken two or three years to submit a police report, says an employee to TV4 Nyheterna. \"Nothing happens\" Several people with insight tell TV4 Nyheterna that the County Administrative Board's long delay in reporting suspected environmental crimes, when it is reported, among other things complicates the police's preliminary investigation and that the police are then several years behind in the investigation. - Partly that. But even then, these activities that caused the environmental crime are allowed to continue and continue to pollute or whatever it is they are doing. In that way, the County Administrative Board becomes complicit in making things worse, says an informant at the authority. It is managers at the authority who must report possible environmental crimes etc",

This was stated by the Federal Customs Service on Thursday. The gray space rock, which weighs over 2.5 tons, was discovered during a routine inspection of a sea container in the port of St. Petersburg.  In the export documents, the cargo was described as a garden sculpture, but when customs officials took a closer look, it quickly became clear that something was not right - neither with the object's origin nor its true value. Cargo worth SEK 38 million The fragment is believed to come from the world-famous Aletai meteorite, one of the largest known iron meteorites on Earth.  In a video released by the authorities, customs personnel can be seen breaking open a wooden box and exposing the massive stone, with a rough, gray and uneven surface. According to Russian customs authorities, the meteorite fragment could be worth around 323 million rubles – equivalent to almost 38 million kroner. 4.5 billion years old Who is behind the smuggling attempt has not been made public, but authorities confirm that the destination was Britain. A criminal investigation has now been opened by prosecutors. The Aletai meteorite was discovered in western China back in 1898 and is estimated to be at least 4.5 billion years old – almost as old as the solar system itself.

The aircraft began to accelerate, reaching about 200 kilometers per hour, according to FlightRadar.  Suddenly the pilots realized they were on the taxiway, the road used to get out to the runway. They were forced to cross, veered left and ended up in the grass. - It is very serious, says aviation expert and former SAS pilot Björn Lundström. He believes that it could have been much, much worse. - A car could have come out on this taxiway or another plane or other traffic, he says and adds: - Then they would have had a collision. Deadly examples In commercial traffic, it is very rare for aircraft to take off from the taxiway. But there are examples. Last year, a Boeing 737-800 was aborted from takeoff after air traffic control at Orlando airport discovered they were on the taxiway.  Björn Lundström also raises a tragic example from 2000. At the airport in Singapore, a passenger plane bound for Los Angeles began to take off from a closed runway.  The plane collided with construction machinery and equipment and 83 people died.  Swedes on board Several KD politicians were on the plane.  - As I understand it, it would have been difficult to stop the plane if we had driven five more seconds, says Dan-Ove Marcelind (KD) to Expressen. According to him, the staff was stressed because the flight was heavily delayed.  - Stress is a risk factor for a pilot, you know that, so you should be extra vigilant, says Björn Lundström. He is surprised by the incident. The taxiway is marked with completely different lighting and signs compared to the runways.  Björn Lundström also says that the aircraft probably had a map in the cockpit with the exact position.

The suspected abuses took place between 2009 and 2013, and at the end of May last year, over 160 former students at the school where the teacher worked received letters from the police stating that they are plaintiffs in the investigation.  Now the Södertörn district court announces that the prosecution will not be tried, because the teacher was convicted in 2023 by the Svea Court of Appeal for several cases of child pornography crimes. The penalty was three years and six months in prison - a sentence he is still serving. - The films in this case were included in the previous indictment, but the plaintiffs were then unidentified. If the prosecutor had wanted to test how it happened when the films were recorded, this would have been investigated before charges were brought for the possession of the films, says councilor Fredrik Nydén, who was the court's chairman.  The district court has also ruled that the surreptitious filming, which the man admitted, does not fall under the criminal classification of sexual harassment, which was required for the plaintiff to receive damages. This means that all claims for damages have been rejected. \"Hard to find words\" Hanna Charlton is one of the 50 affected girls. She is 22 years old today. - That the verdict resulted in zero extended sentence and zero kroner in compensation to the victims is completely unimaginable to me, given what he has actually done to us over so many years. I have difficulty finding words for this, she says to TV4 Nyheterna. Although the legal process is aimed at the individual man and the crimes he committed, Hanna thinks that other actors also have a great responsibility in this.

She believes that Dumpen has worked for several years to bring about a change in the law.  - In the midst of all this, we have children who feel terribly bad, who harm themselves and who cannot be rehabilitated. That's how tragic it can be. We're talking about children who can't protect themselves, that's where we adults need to intervene, not grown men who feel violated, she says. The man: Feeling very bad It was a couple of years ago that Dumpen confronted the man, who the site claimed had sex-chatted with a 14-year-old. The man was then publicly hanged and the post was widely circulated. After the publication, the man stated that he felt very unwell and was unable to work.

She must also pay SEK 43,100 in damages to the man. \"Sweden forgets the children\" Sara Nilsson is critical of the man now being awarded damages. - The Swedish state is probably quite alone in providing these gentlemen with money so that they can buy new hardware so that they can continue to look for children online, she says and continues: - It is sadness and frustration.

But now the trend has turned.  The number of confirmed cases and patients in intensive care is increasing. - We'll see if it's just a temporary bump in the curve and it goes down in the future or if there will be an increase again, says Magnus Gisslén. Klara Sondén, deputy state epidemiologist at the Public Health Agency says that the rise is quite expected after the Christmas holidays. - We are all on site in schools and workplaces. You have many contacts, so it is easy for the infection to spread from person to person. The Public Health Agency predicts that the spread of influenza will continue in the coming months.  It is the new aggressive mutation H3N2 that dominates the spread of infection right now.   - It can escape our immune system a little easier than other variants precisely because it has changed so much. The effect of vaccines is also slightly worse on this variant. Winter sickness on the rise As far as winter sickness is concerned, the peak has not been reached. The spread of infection is on the rise and the number of confirmed cases at the Public Health Agency is higher compared to the same period last year.  Everything indicates that the spread of infection continues to increase, it will take some time before the curves start to turn downwards. - You can count on it to increase now for a number of weeks until March, says Magnus Gisslén. The Swedish Public Health Agency urges you to wash your hands thoroughly and stay home if you are sick.  If you have symptoms of a respiratory infection, remember to show special consideration to the people who are at risk of becoming seriously ill. This applies even if your symptoms are mild.",

The band was supposed to ride a fire pole down on stage, but because they had much heavier equipment than you normally have as a firefighter, Olle injured his hand.  - There are things that happen, but he is not allowed to ride the pole on Saturday, says band member Glenn Borgkvist to TV4 Nyheterna.  Olle Östberg was forced to sew four stitches and Brandsta had to redo the number. Among other things, they are introducing a \"Brandsta dunk\" instead of the classic \"Brandsta clap\".  - He's not allowed to pole now, but that's what happens - you have to improvise a bit. We'll work it out, but he'll be damned if we have to cast his whole hand.  Haven't been in Mello for 23 years Brandta City Släckers haven't competed in Melodifestivalen since 2003 and thus become one of the year's biggest comebacks to the competition.  - It's crazy fun, completely crazy but great fun. It could be that we weren't interesting anymore, but we've gotten a lot of attention so it's great fun. We are tagged, says Glenn Borgkvist.  Together with band members Mats Nilsson, Ulf Johansson and Tom Börjesson, Olle and Glenn perform the song \"Rakt in i elden\" in Melodifestivalen's second competition.  - It's a song with a lot of joy, it's \"smoke n' roll 2.0\", but it sounds like 2026 and it should, says Glenn Borgkvist to TV4 Nyheterna.",

The Reaggeton artist was the most streamed artist on Spotify last year and is an outspoken Trump critic.  During the performance, several famous artists appeared, including Lady Gaga and Ricky Martin. In addition to performing his most famous songs from the album \"Debí tirar mas fotos\", Bad Bunny finished by listing a number of countries from Central and South America and saying \"god bless america\".  He also carried an American football with the text \"Together we are America\". In the background, the text \"The only thing more powerful than hate is love\" appeared on the big screen.

  "c8deb7947e8201f0f91891d22738e5156006b3c9": "The fact that you lose income by babbling is perhaps not so strange. Money from Försäkringskassan covers just under 80 percent of the salary and there is also a cap on how much money you can get. But for the vast majority of people, vaping does not have a very large impact on the future pension, according to the Pensions Authority, which believes that it is sometimes presented as vaping can be a big sink. Vabb affects the pension to a very small extent. The allowance from Försäkringskassan is pensionable, although it may be slightly lower than the salary. In addition, the employer usually continues to pay into the occupational pension, which is therefore not affected, says Monica Zettervall at the Swedish Pensions Agency. Part-time a criminal According to the authority, it is a matter of relatively few kroner a month in reduced pension calculated over an entire working life. The pension system has built-in airbags which mean that parenthood affects the pension very little, says Monica Zettervall. What rather affects the pension is, among other things, how one chooses to share the parental allowance and the unpaid work in the home, for which women take responsibility to a greater extent. Part-time work is a factor that affects the long term. If you work part-time for more than four years when the children are small, it can start to be felt in the pension. During the first four years, there is pension entitlement for childhood years in the general pension system, which largely compensates for the loss of income.  Small difference Generally, high income earners in the private sector are affected more than those with low and medium incomes in the state and municipality, according to Zettervall.  The call from the Swedish Pensions Authority is not to worry too much about the pension when you are at home with a sick child. Most people who open their orange envelope won't see much of a difference because you've vacillated. I think it creates a lot of unnecessary anxiety, says Monica Zettervall.",

During the latest party leader debate, KD leader Ebba Busch attacked Magdalena Andersson (S) on the issue of maternity care and women's health. - If you compare the social democratic efforts during the whole eight years, they still do not reach what has been achieved during the last three years, said Ebba Busch, among other things. Tidöpartierna invests on a national level One of the crown jewels of Tidöpartierna's investments is a national plan for pregnancy, childbirth and aftercare. Recently, the government issued a press release stating that it is now making a \"major investment\" in maternity care and women's health. Among other things, it concerns targeted government support to the regions of around SEK 1 billion. But in previous years, the corresponding money bag in the state budget has been around SEK 1.6 billion. Health Minister Elisabet Lann points out that the government is putting money into a number of areas related to women's health, in addition to maternity care. - We are allocating SEK 200 million to care for victims of sexual violence. We are also putting half a billion extra into cancer healthcare, where breast cancer is the most common form of cancer. It is also great means of shortening the queues for prolapse operations. It is something that only women demand and need, she says. S criticizes the government for fiddling with numbers But the Social Democrats in the Stockholm region are now storming against the government's measures - which they consider to be fiddling with numbers. - The Swedish healthcare system has gone through a national healthcare crisis with great notice around the country. We know that it is the healthcare staff who are the most important resource in healthcare in order for us to shorten care queues and provide care as needed. The government must also see that, says Aida Hadzialic (S), regional councilor in Stockholm. - The entire Swedish healthcare system needs more resources. Our operating rooms, our medical centers",

Just over two weeks later, it announced to German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius that Germany will help Ukraine develop drones that can strike targets deep inside Russia. Now the plans are about to be realized - at least in Germany. This is stated by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a post on X. \"As early as mid-February, our drones will be produced in Germany,\" says Zelenskyy. Opening export centers in the Nordic countries The venture in Germany is one of several similar production lines in Europe, the president states. In the UK, production is said to be already underway. In addition to arms production, Ukraine will open a total of ten export centers in the Nordic and Baltic countries during the year. It is not clear exactly which countries are covered, but the Reuters news agency has previously reported that similar centers have been opened in both Copenhagen and Berlin in order to export the surplus from the joint production of weapons. - This is about co-production and export of the weapons that we can allow ourselves to sell in order to bring in more money for our own production of things that we lack and do not have money for, Zelenskyy told Reuters. Explosive increase in drones Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost four years ago, the country's investment in the defense industry in general – and drone production in particular – has increased explosively. In another post on X, Volodymyr Zelenskyj states that Ukraine now has 450 different producers of drones, of which 50 are world class. Together, they make up the largest industry currently operating in the country, according to the president. \"Aviation is one of the promising investment areas in Ukraine. Everyone wants to invest,\" says Zelenskyy. Production is not Ukraine's only success on the drone front. Recently, Elon Musk's space company SpaceX announced that it was shutting down",

You also need to learn to show respect for that, says Anna Brolin.

  "03d5cad54cc679077f9a7f9e74d7de73aaac5dd8": "Since the start of this year's ski season, more than 50 people have died in avalanche accidents in the Alps, according to the European Avalanche Warning Services (EAWS). Last Saturday, four people died in two separate avalanche accidents in Italy. The reason behind the fatal accidents can be several, and the snow-poor winter that prevails in large parts of the Alps is likely one of them. Less snow means that the snow is less compacted, and in addition weak layers of snow can remain for several weeks. - They are difficult for the common man to follow - and also for professionals, says Petter Palmgren, avalanche expert at the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency. A catalyst for accidents In addition to weather, a large proportion of accidents can be explained by the human factor. The majority of avalanches that occur are triggered naturally, but the avalanches that lead to deaths are almost exclusively triggered by humans, says Petter Palmgren. Statistically, accidents increase the more people are in the ski systems, and therefore the combination of newly fallen snow and snow-poor winters is a bit of a catalyst for accidents. - When a little snow finally falls, many people are starved for good skiing. Large avalanches are then quite common. Until the beginning of February in the previous two seasons, a total of 28 and 30 people respectively lost their lives in avalanche accidents in the Alps, according to figures from EAWS. This year, there have thus been almost twice as many fatal accidents within the same time period. - It's probably quite a lot for the time of year, says Petter Palmgren. \"It's not a good idea to go off-piste\" According to Petter Palmgren, off-piste skiers, top tourers and to some extent climbers are responsible for almost all avalanche-related deaths. Especially off-piste skating is popular among Swedes, and the sports holiday is just around the corner. - It is time to be extra careful if you go off-piste or go on a trip in the Alps during the sports holiday. These are risky activities that require preparation. Read up on the weather conditions and forecasts, and think about what you can and can't handle. It can go very quickly from feeling undramatic to a",

  "ab207eda691bfea1d776f4767fb1c5b8c0900466": "Far-right graffiti in Stockholm's schools has increased by 140 percent in the past three years, according to Stockholm city statistics reported by P4 Stockholm. At Skarpnäck's elementary school, racist stickers and swastikas have been discovered. The school management has urged parents to talk to their children about what happened. According to Christer Mattsson, researcher and expert on right-wing extremism and violence at the University of Gothenburg, the increase is neither unique to Stockholm nor a new phenomenon. - The behavior with doodles is something that goes in waves, he says. \"Generates a curiosity\" He links the development to the attention that has been around new far-right groups in recent years. - I would interpret it as being related to the attention that has been around new extreme right-wing groups, not least the active clubs, which in turn generate a curiosity and then you move that aesthetic out to the outside world. Similar graffiti waves have been seen before in Sweden, according to Mattsson. He points to the 1960s and the so-called squint epidemic. - The first wave was named the swastika epidemic where swastikas start to be scribbled everywhere and actually led to the first school effort in Sweden to raise awareness about the Holocaust. Today, doodling is not always about clear swastikas. Instead, more subtle symbols and number combinations are often used. - In a subculture, you would like to have symbols that you in that culture understand, but which are more difficult to understand for others. It creates a sense of belonging. Nazi memes An example is the number 14. - It is from an old Nazi slogan, it becomes 14 words, and this has been around for a long time. It is something that recurs and is reproduced in different contexts. At the same time, Mattsson believes that graffiti in a school environment is often connected to a wider exposure, above all digitally. - What is much more constant and at a much higher level, are the memes that appear on social media. Then you take the step Facing the messages repeatedly can have consequences, both for them",

Early on, investigators had both DNA and witness information about a woman in a black jacket and pink sweatpants, but despite extensive efforts, the killer went free for almost two decades. - One week, then it's solved, they said. A week passed, then two weeks passed, then a month passed, then three months passed, then six months passed, then a year, says Marie's sister Birgitta Borén in The Murder of Marie - that's why the killer goes free on TV4 PLAY The DNA finding was decisive The police were convinced for a long time that the case would be solved quickly. The coroner found clear repulsive injuries and the perpetrator had left traces of blood after cutting himself during the attack. Anders Eriksson is involved when the police in the West start a new cold case group in 2016 and the murder of Marie is one of the cases that the group takes on. - In terms of investigation, it is not a complicated matter in view of the forensic evidence. If we find the person who has deposited his DNA through blood, then it is the perpetrator, he says.  The big turnaround Despite phantom images, surveillance footage and tips from the public, the breakthrough was delayed. Only in 2022, when a woman in her 40s was busted after a minor theft, was her DNA matched to the findings from the murder scene. The police were sure they had found Marie's killer.  But the joy was short-lived. The woman was only 17 years old at the time of the murder, and the statute of limitations for murder of minors was then 15 years. The DNA meeting came about two years too late - and no trial could ever be held. - It's bad for everyone. There is no winner in that it has turned out the way it has with these rules, says Anders Eriksson. Sentenced for new crimes The woman who the police are sure is guilty of the murder was recently sentenced to prison for aggravated theft against the elderly in her work in home care. But she has never spoken publicly about Marie's murder.\n\nHow is it to know that we will most likely never come",

The trial began this week and is heavily covered by the media. In total, the indictment covers 38 points and the negotiations are expected to last for several months, partly behind closed doors. According to Leif GW Persson, there is a clear risk that the extensive reporting affects those who must take a position on the evidence. - There is, of course, a significant risk that it affects them. In this case, it is not to the benefit of the person charged, namely the bonus prince, says Persson in Nyhetsmorgon. Compare with the Dacosta trial Leif GW Persson draws parallels to Swedish legal cases where massive media attention had consequences for the legal process. He specifically cites the Dacosta trial as an example. - Justice feels good about being able to work in peace. But it won't be allowed to do that here, he says. According to Persson, the situation is further complicated by the fact that Høiby's mother, Crown Princess Mette-Marit, has recently been linked to the Epstein affair.  - It has nothing to do with his case, but it comes as an additional burden. He also seems to be feeling very unwell, and it is not to his advantage either, says Persson. Extensive prosecution - but uncertain outcome Among the 38 charges are four suspected rapes, one assault and crimes such as drug offences, vandalism and various forms of molestation. According to Persson, Høiby has partially admitted to some less serious crimes, but denies the assault and rape. - He will not be convicted on all counts. If he goes all the way, he risks up to 16 years in prison, but that will not be an issue, says Persson. He is also doubtful whether the trial will even lead to a prison sentence. - I am not even sure that he will be sentenced to prison. But I dare not speculate. \"Not extenuating\" According to Persson, the defense has emphasized Høiby's upbringing and that he lived most of his",

A day later, Otto Gernandt left his role as the company's CFO to take on an advisory role. The announcement from the green steel company is ominous, says Ossi Pesämaa, assistant professor of accounting and management at Luleå University of Technology. - Key people abandon ship, it's quite critical. A total of around SEK 70 billion has been invested in the green steel project. As a comparison, industry colleague SSAB's has a market capitalization of just over SEK 76 billion. - Stegra's loans are thus almost as large as one of Sweden's largest industrial groups. Add to that that Stegra is not even fully built, and in such a complex industrial plant there will be many elements and uncertainties even after completion, says Ossi Pesämaa. May need to double the loans According to Ossi Pesämaa, Stegra's facility is about 60 percent complete. Construction costs have skyrocketed and port construction has been put on hold. The financiers turn a blind eye. - Now you have applied for ten billion more, but if you are only halfway there, maybe another 70 billion is required - and maybe a little more. Where are they going to find that money now that the trust capital is at the bottom?, asks Ossi Pesämaa. Stegra's situation is increasingly reminiscent of bankrupt Northvolt. Stegra is structured in the same way and, just like Northvolt, has been able to show order books as security for financing. Now they are burdened - just as the battery law did - by multibillion-dollar debts and a trust that has run to rock bottom. - I think it is very likely that this will fall apart. The problem: Optimism bias Steel production worldwide accounts for around eight percent of global carbon dioxide emissions. In Sweden, the figure is around ten percent. It is therefore no wonder that green investments such as Stegra have gained popularity. In working condition, it would be a hyper-modern company with doubled steel production with non-existent colds",

Renat Mukmenov was sent to the front in the summer of 2024, and in mid-August communication ceased. - I suspect that the number of people considering signing a contract and going to war will only increase as the Russian economy slows down and wage increases slow down, says Alexander Kolyandr, visiting researcher at the Center for European Policy Analysis to the BBC.  15 times higher chance of dying The area of ​​Zabaikalsky kray, where Renat Mukmenov came from, is one of the poorest regions in Russia and, according to the analysis, has one of the highest rates of fatalities per capita. Residents of the region are 15 times more likely to die in the war than residents of Moscow. - Calm in the capitals and the North Caucasus has traditionally been very important for maintaining social order and stability in Russia, says Alexander Kolyandr. There are a couple of exceptions to the analysis. In some of Russia's poorest regions – Chechnya, Ingushetia and Karachay-Cherkessia – deaths per capita are on a par with the rich cities of Moscow and Saint Petersburg. Sent to the front instead of trial Over half of all dead are voluntary, mobilized or convicted criminals from correctional facilities. People who had no connection to the army before the outbreak of war. Defendants in criminal cases have fallen among the dead, compared to a year ago.",

Brandsta City Släcker's \"Rakt in i elden\" has been the favorite from the start and now goes directly to the final. The band's orange firefighter uniforms have also stood the test of time. - These are our original clothes since \"Kom och ta mig\" and they have ridden the fire truck with us before that, singer Glenn Borgkvist has told. In the pyrotechnics-dense number, where flames lick the edge of the stage and fly in the air almost constantly, it gets really hot in the thick jackets. Drummer Tom Börjesson has stated that it is important to get enough liquid. - We have heard that beer is supposed to be the best. Moved to tears It was a moved Felicia who wiped away the tears and barely managed to sing the opening of her song \"My system\" when she was presented as a finalist. - You mustn't cry, what a shame, she said on her way up to the stage. Felicia has been a favorite from the start with \"My system\", which has more techno and house vibes than her previous songs in the epadunk genre such as Fröken Snusk. The artist himself has speculated whether it might scare viewers away. - I think the song is one that goes better outside Sweden, she has said. She last competed in 2024, then with the song \"Young & free\" - which went on to the final qualification but fell on the finish line and missed the final. Then she felt mentally ill and the feeling is completely different now, she has told TT. - It cannot be compared to last time. I feel so good now and am so busy. It feels absolutely fantastic. Former Melodifestival winner Robin Bengtsson, who is participating for the fifth time, clinched the place in the final qualification with the country song \"Honey honey\". Sung gospel Melodifestivalen's second competition, which takes place in Gothenburg, got off to a flying start in the form of a gospel number. Hampus Nessvold, backed by a choir, sang about how Melodifestivalen is his religion. Previous win",

The high pressure literally pushes down the water, which is pushed out of the Baltic Sea. In Stockholm, the water level is now the lowest in at least 15 years, according to SMHI.  17th century wreck visible The weather phenomenon has caused the Orlogsfartyget at Kastellholmen in Stockholm to look forward. The shipwreck from the 17th century is 40 meters long and usually lies below the surface of the water. The ship has not been wrecked, but sunk on the spot, which means that the ship is very intact.  - When it was no longer worth repairing the ships, the navy reused the material and sunk them. It's a cool phenomenon, instead of using new wood, they use old ship scrap, says Jim Hansson, marine archaeologist at the Wreck Museum to Dagens Nyheter. But the low water levels have also caused it in its parts. Around 20 piers have been pulled into the Stockholm archipelago because the boats cannot dock. It is also difficult for the boats to dock at Strömkajen because the angle of the gangway is too steep. - Absolutely, it causes it, we have some piers where the boats cannot dock, says Helene Jakobsson, business area manager for sea traffic. But boat traffic is among the lowest of the year and Helene Jakobsson is not particularly concerned about the inhabitants of the archipelago. - There is an awareness of the power of the weather when you live out in the archipelago, she says. The pressure will release next week The long-term high pressure over Sweden will slowly but surely move away and turn into a low pressure. - The water level looks like it will drop another couple of days ahead, then turn around in the middle of the week, when the weather will be more low-pressure based according to the forecast, says Madeleine Westin. But even that can create problems, according to Madeleine Westin. As the ice spreads across the Baltic Sea, bridges can",

  "418bda8ecb4237e60fe5454fd93fed1a742fc58d": "After Sara Nilsson, one of the founders of the pedophile hunting site Dumpen, was convicted of defamation, the Sweden Democrats party leader Jimmie Åkesson swished money to her. He has also offered that SD should pay for the entire damages and legal costs, a sum of over half a million. Star lawyer Kristofer Stahre is now directing harsh criticism at Åkesson and SD. - If a crime is committed and the politicians do not agree with the legislation, they step in and pay the penalty. It sounds completely off the wall, he says to TV4 Nyheterna. \"Fish in murky waters\" He believes that the politicians should instead change the law if they are not satisfied with the legislation. - It sends completely wrong signals to the Swedish people. The fact that some people are above the law about it means that Jimmie Åkesson does not agree with the legislation. The lawyer sees major problems with the idea that one should be allowed to slander people if what is said is true. - That assessment is always made after the fact, and it risks affecting an awful lot of innocent people. Tidö has opened for a change in the law Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson (M) has previously opened for changing the defamation legislation so that, for example, you can warn neighbors about sex offenders in the neighborhood, something Stahre thinks you should be careful about. - I am afraid that you are fishing in cloudy waters. It is votes you are looking for before the election. You don't see the risks, says Kristofer Stahre. Jimmie Åkesson defends the payment in a debate article on Expressen. He calls the verdict a \"judicial scandalous splash\" and believes that Swedish defamation legislation has become a \"protection for predators\". Åkesson: \"Pull where the pepper grows\" Jimmie Åkesson responds to the criticism in a post on the platform X. This is what he writes: \"Pull where the pepper grows. Yes, it is unconventional as a legislator to pay a fine to an individual who has committed a crime. But, those of you who choose to focus on that instead of the absurdity of an honorable citizen being convicted for doing the morally right thing can pull the trigger",

She's only been here for two weeks but is already finding herself in the huge hospital. - Here I can come and get dialysis without all the noise of bombs, airplanes and helicopters, she says in a firm voice. She is one of the few children evacuated from Gaza for care. Right now, several different organizations believe that between 18-20,000 patients need to leave the Gaza Strip to receive better care. Last Monday, the Rafah border between Gaza and Egypt was opened and many hoped to be able to go to a better hospital outside Gaza.  But the process is both slow and complicated, which has meant that only around 100 patients plus their relatives were able to leave in just over a week. The patients in Amman have gone via the Kerem Shalom crossing, through Israel to Jordan. - The process is extremely slow, difficult and cumbersome. The king of Jordan has said that we will help 2,000 children but so far we have only managed to get 650 children out. I'm afraid that many will die because the wait is so long, says Fawzi Al-Hammouri doctor Specialty hospital. War injuries and a long wait The patients who have come to Amman are a mixture of children with war injuries, cancer or who need internal medicine.  Inside the physiotherapy, we meet the sisters Sarah, 15 and Saraa, 17. They were both badly injured when the house fell on them after a bomb attack in northern Gaza. Saraa was injured in the knees and operated on in Gaza and can now walk relatively well. But Sarah, who injured her neck and spine, could not get help on the spot. - I couldn't move my arms or legs. But it took 6 months before I could be evacuated from Gaza. Here in Amman they operated on me and through physiotherapy I have regained some of my strength, she says. Both sisters study remotely and want to become doctors and physiotherapists. - After what we have been through, we want to use the experience gained to help others, says Saraa. 10-year-old Rama will probably stay in Amman for a long time.

You must not say that I am selling for a certain purpose when it is a completely different purpose that I am selling for. Then you mislead consumers, says consumer advisor Maria Wiezell.

Jona Dervishi, coach in Gällivare SK, emphasizes the importance of the night trains for the club's business.  - It's super important, we live where we live and are far from everywhere. We always aim to go by train because it is the safest way to travel. We have competitions in Sundsvall, Västerås, Falköping, Gothenburg and various camps. The night trains affect our business a lot, says Jona Dervishi. Reduced opportunities for sports Traveling at night also means that the children do not have to take time off from school to travel to the competitions. The alternative of flying is too expensive. When the night trains north of Umeå are reduced from two to one, it becomes more difficult to find tickets that suit the club's needs.   - This means fewer competitions and it leads to fewer wrestlers, so our business will be significantly reduced, says Jona Dervishi. According to the government, the change is due to SJ taking over night train traffic at short notice at the end of 2024, which was expensive for the Swedish Transport Administration. The government has pushed for money, but no earmarked for double departures north of Umeå.   - It is, of course, important that there are good conditions for accessibility within and to and from Norrland and that is why the government allocates large funds to this type of procured traffic and we have pushed to a quarter of a billion since 2025, but at the same time it is important to get a handle on these costs, they cannot continue to rise and that is why the Swedish Transport Administration has been forced to this emergency brake. But the government has also tasked the Swedish Transport Administration with reviewing both the organization and financing of the state's night train fleet for the future, so we have a long-term solution to this, says infrastructure minister Andreas Carlsson (KD). Have been forced to pull the emergency brake Isn't it the government's job to secure train traffic throughout the country? - The government pushes to significant amounts, a quarter",

Several sources told the newspaper that President Zelenskyi will announce the election on February 24, the anniversary of the full-scale invasion. A high voter turnout is required At the same time, several sources state that the timetable is somewhat optimistic and that several factors affect whether it can actually happen, including how far you can get in the negotiations for a peace agreement. Zelenskyj has previously stated that it is not possible to hold an election when the country is in a state of emergency. Around 20 percent of the country is occupied by Russia and a large number of the country's citizens are on the run.  The pressure to hold an election is said to come from the United States, which reportedly wants to see an end to the war before mid-term elections in November. - They say they want everything ready by June, so that the war ends, says Zelenskyj and adds: - They want a clean schedule, says Zelenskyj, referring to the time before the mid-term elections.  One source states that at least half of the voters who were registered before the full-scale invasion must participate in the election - otherwise it may lack international legitimacy. Something that Russia could exploit.  \"He must bow to Trump\" TV4 Nyhetern's foreign commentator Johan Fredriksson believes that Trump and the American negotiators have been fed lies from Russia about an \"illegitimate Nazi regime\" ruling in Kiev. - Now Volodymyr Zelenskyj must in practice refute the lies and show the USA that his government has the support of the people. This despite the fact that Ukraine's constitution and election laws prohibit the conduct of presidential, parliamentary and local elections as long as the country is in a state of war, says Johan Fredriksson. At the same time, he believes that Zelenskyi has no other choice.  - He has to bow and bow to Trump and his ideas and now the White House has set an ultimatum: first carry out elections, then an agreement on military security",

Two people were found dead in a residence believed to be connected to the crime.  Police have not yet released the ages of the victims. Nor if the perpetrator is a minor or an adult.

The warning asked everyone in the area to stay inside, lock doors and not approach the school. Around 27 people are said to have been injured, two of whom have serious or life-threatening injuries. Floyd says police will not release the ages of the victims at this time. The small community of Tumbler Ridge, where the mass shooting took place, has about 2,400 residents.

Details: Arrested in a taxi A person has been arrested in a taxi near the crime scene, according to TV4 Nyhetern's information. It will be about a man in his 20s. He is now suspected of attempted murder. According to the TV4 Nyheternas reporter on the spot, the atmosphere was chaotic. The police were able to confirm on Tuesday that they are working with a larger resource at the scene, but not that any suspected perpetrator has been arrested. - What we can say is that we get an alarm about loud bangs and go there.

Man in his 20s arrested On Tuesday morning, the police announced that prosecutors had chosen to arrest a man in his 20s who had been arrested. He is suspected of attempted murder. According to the police, it is still too early to say whether the incident is gang-related. The classification is attempted murder.",

In the program, Marcus Andersson expresses that Marina Westerlund was his favorite of the three remaining girls - something that surprised her. - I am very shocked by what Marcus said. It would have been good if he told me. But I don't regret my decision. I felt nothing for Marcus. I would probably have gone home anyway, she says.  Marcus: Wouldn't have made any difference For TV4 Nyheterna, Marcus Andersson says that he doesn't think it would have made any difference if Marina Westerlund had been told that she was his favorite. - I guess I didn't really feel right for her either.

In total, they and the dog Aloka have walked over 370 miles before they now reach the American capital. - It's a bit like the great elk migration to follow these monks. What they create around them is very special, says Håkan Friedel, who is a Buddhist. Accidents and challenges on the way The walk has not been without difficulties. In Texas, a car crashed into the caravan, forcing one of the monks to have a leg amputated. In South Carolina, the dog Aloka needed surgery before he could continue. Despite the cold of the American winter, the monks have continued, often barefoot and sometimes without even lying down when sleeping. - These are very advanced donuts as far as I understand. So they take on a special exercise for themselves, for their own sake, to be able to reach deeper into themselves, says Håkan Friedel. Great commitment and meetings with politicians Thousands of people have followed the monks along the way and millions have become involved online. During the walk, they have stopped to talk to both ordinary people and politicians. - There are a lot of conflicts in America. It feels very right that the monks are out walking and talking to people. They stop and share what they have with them, says Håkan Friedel. The monks will participate in several events in Washington. They also plan to submit a request to Congress for the Buddha's birthday to be officially observed, although they themselves emphasize that the most important thing is meeting people. - Of course, the big overarching goal has been to walk for world peace, but it is undeniably the case, as a monk put it, that the goal has also been to get people along the way to stop and get distraction from the problems that weigh on them in everyday life, says Filip Jacobson, foreign correspondent.",

Unlike other eating disorders, Arfid is not about body ideals or weight, but about a strong reluctance or fear of food, often linked to taste, smell or texture. Klara Edlund, psychologist and researcher, emphasizes that Arfid is not about being picky or spoiled. - This is about a neurobiologically rooted eating disorder. It's about a strong inability to eat enough, which means you end up with both energy and nutritional deficiencies, says Klara Edlund. \"It comes physically from within\" Many people with Arfid describe a strong fear of negative consequences of eating, such as vomiting or choking. For Clara Lager, the fear has sometimes led to panic attacks and severe anxiety, even though she tries to have a positive attitude. - When that reflex comes and that discomfort comes, it's like I have no power over it. It comes physically from within. It's not something I get for myself, but I want to be able to eat like everyone else, she says. Treatment with CBT Klara Edlund urges you to seek help via a health centre, BVC or school nurse if you suspect Arfid in yourself or your child. Despite the fact that knowledge of Arfid is low, there is help to be had.

  "630e51f250e2b195a916ab9d755d8a333df0579d": "After Sara Nilsson, one of the founders of the pedophile hunting site Dumpen, was convicted of defamation, the Sweden Democrats party leader Jimmie Åkesson swished her money. He has also offered that SD should pay for the entire damages and legal costs - a sum of over half a million kroner. The action is not only problematic, but it also violates the constitution, says lawyer and former Social Democratic Minister of Justice Thomas Bodström. It is clearly stated in the form of government that members of the Riksdag may not intervene in individual cases. - When he gets involved in how courts should judge by criticizing them, he has crossed a very important line. Politicians must not rule the courts. And that is precisely what we criticize Trump for all the time, he tells TV4 Nyheterna. \"It's nonsense and everyone understands it\" In a debate article in Expressen, Bodström writes together with lawyer Hanna Larsson Rampe that Åkesson's and SD's donations encourage a convicted person to continue committing crimes. \"SD's rhetoric is that those of us who dare to criticize Dumpen's actions would rather protect the pedophiles than the children. It is nonsense and anyone who thinks about it understands that. Nor can they justify their actions by saying that sexual abuse of children is a heinous crime, because this is a view that basically everyone shares,\" write the lawyers. They also express a concern that Jimmie Åkesson may be part of a future government, and specifically as Minister of Justice - which the party leader has explicitly said he wants to be. - If you are in the government, you have enormous power and can pardon anyone without reasonable grounds. If he were to become Minister of Justice, he would, for example, have the right to pardon Sara Nilsson, says Bodström to TV4 Nyheterna. Åkesson: \"We take the initiative to do it\" Jimmie Åkesson has \"no understanding whatsoever\" of the criticism surrounding the Dumpen swish, he tells TV4 Nyheterna. - It is a way to signal very clearly that we think the defamation legislation is wrong and needs to be changed.

  "141a5f3127f86e751a459a957a894f2fdec73cf2": "The 30-year-old was detained last weekend by the Västmanland district court. During the hearing, the man admitted to the crime of sabotage and agreed to be detained. - He admits that he was there, that's what I can say, says District Attorney Magnus Möller, who has the case on his table. Arrested on the run The incident took place at 02.30 on January 30. The police were then alerted to Mälarenergi's facility in Västerås. The power at the Hässlö waterworks had been cut off after a sabotage against the electrical installations inside the protected area. A police patrol was able to quickly track down the saboteur and arrested the 30-year-old when he tried to run from the scene. According to information to TV4 Nyheterna, the man was wearing a cap with the Russian coat of arms when he was arrested. - We do not go into more detail about what information we have or what our cooperation with the Police Authority looks like in individual cases, says Jonathan Svensson, press spokesperson at the Security Police, Säpo. Unknown motive The 30-year-old man has appeared in the legal system since a young age and has a long criminal record with several serious crimes. He has been sentenced together with, among others, a well-known leader of a notorious criminal network and has been involved in high-profile gang cases. Säpo has previously come out and warned of increased threats of sabotage from Russia. However, the prosecutor does not want to comment on the information that the detainee had the Russian state coat of arms. - There is preliminary investigation secrecy, so I cannot go into details. I must point out that there will be a preliminary investigation protocol where it will appear, says Magnus Möller. According to the prosecutor, no motive behind the nocturnal sabotage has yet been discovered. - So far we don't have that. But he will be interrogated once more and it may become clearer then, says Magnus Möller. \"Very serious\" According to Mälarenergi, the sabotage did not lead to any impact on the quality of the drinking water. - But due to the power outage at the Hässlö waterworks on the night of January 30, the waterworks could not supply drinking water",

  "402332fe1356aa00d70d52264090d5dab646d6ea": "When Malmö city inspectors recently visited a wholesale company, 5.2 tons of approximately one-year-old candy were discovered that were about to be relabeled with new best-before dates. This is reported by the news agency Siren. Two people who were working on packaging goods in connection with ten pallets of candy boxes immediately left the premises when the inspectors showed up, according to the environmental administration.  - We are doing outreach to inventory premises, including in this area, which is densely packed with wholesalers. When two people stick out immediately when we arrive, it of course arouses our interest, says unit manager Caroline Tandefelt to Nyhetsbyrån Siren. On a follow-up visit, those in charge stated that the candy had accidentally not been disposed of. \"In the premises there were prepared packing surfaces, empty new cartons, unused bags for repackaging, tape, sealing machine and solvents in the form of acetone and nail polish remover with the aim of removing labels and erasing the best before date\", writes the environmental administration in its decision. Cat chasing mice The spaces in the premises were also dirty and unhygienic. Among other things, a cat had been placed there to keep mice and vermin away. \"There was a litter box in the toilet and cat food was stored in the fridge,\" the decision states. In recent years, the wholesale company has been the subject of several controls and banning decisions.  Contact with Danish colleagues The delivery in question, which according to the environmental administration had come from the Netherlands, is still taped up in the premises and is to be destroyed under the supervision of the municipality - We have also been in contact with our Danish colleagues on the other side of the strait. It is about a very large volume, and overall the data we have indicates a certain systematicity, says Caroline Tandefelt to News Agency Siren. The property where the environmental administration's raid took place is owned by another company with partly the same group of owners. Several wholesale companies in the food industry have their warehouses nearby.",

  "bc93af5c72c807b977b09509cb2ee6ef7d4a655c": "The accident occurred during the bench press WC in Eskilstuna on January 25. After lifting 170 kilos, Livia Blomqvist, 23, tried to break the Nordic record of 178 kilos. During the lift, she heard a crack - and then another - as the bar ended up at the wrong angle and both arms broke. - Then it felt like in that second the dream of the World Cup came crashing down, says Livia Blomqvist in Nyhetsmorgon.  \"The second time in my life I've heard of this\" Blomqvist competed in the so-called equipped bench press, a technical branch where everything has to be right. She says that her shoulder blades gave way, causing the bar to go backwards towards her head. The arm ended up at such a bad angle that the leg came off and she lost control of the bar - then the other arm came off too.  Chief physician Mikael Sandström states that it is very unusual for athletes to break both arms at the same time. - It is the second time in my life I have heard about this, says Sandström. Despite the injury, Blomqvist managed to qualify for both the WC and EC, but now awaits a long rehabilitation.  - I try to maintain my body as much as possible and hope to be able to train lighter weights as soon as possible, she says. Tough way back Despite the setback, Blomqvist is determined to get back to the competition scene. She continues to train what she can and hopes that the injury may even give her body time to heal old wear and tear. - If only I can train 40 kilos in the bench press, it will do a lot for my strength, says Blomqvist. The doctors have prescribed at least twelve weeks of rest from heavy load, which makes the WC in May unlikely. Blomqvist is now aiming to be back at the EC in August. - You'll see how the body responds, but I've made up my mind that the EC in August is a more realistic goal.",

In her social media, she has promoted defense spray, something that has led to a positive response from women who she states bought the product after her videos. From the men, the reactions have looked different. - They were very negative about my video and commented a lot. That we imagine that we are so vulnerable. They probably wanted to ridicule it a little in some way, says Amanda Blom.  Defense spray may be carried and used in Sweden for self-defense in an emergency situation. Johanna Björkman, legal expert, explains where the line is drawn between emergency protection and assault. - You always have to defend yourself against, for example, an unprovoked or ongoing attack. But you must never be the one who initiates something by starting to use this spray, for example unnecessarily or to ward off someone who may not have an intention at all or has misunderstood something, says Johanna Björkman.  \"The body thinks it's burning\" Defense spray is legal, unlike pepper spray, which is illegal to possess, buy or bring into Sweden. Chemist Johanna Thompson explains what the various products contain and how they affect the body.  - In both cases, it is a hijacking of the body's own defense system, says Johanna Thompson.  Pepper spray contains the active substance capsaicin, which is extracted from chili fruit.  - The body thinks it's on fire. It is an immediate, inflammatory, very strong reaction, says Johanna Thompson.  She also says that it can cause shortness of breath and lasting pain. Unlike pepper spray, defense spray instead gives signals of extreme cold.  - Here we have a base of menthol in most cases and solvents that will help the menthol to cross the protective membrane of the eye, says Johanna Thompson.

The Trump administration plans this week to overturn a scientific decision from Barack Obama's time as president that is the basis for large parts of the United States' climate policy, The Wall Street Journal reports. If the decision is implemented, it will be the most extensive dismantling of the country's climate policy to date. It is about the so-called \"endangerment finding\" from 2009, where it was determined that six greenhouse gases pose a threat to human health and welfare. The decision has been the legal basis for the environmental authority EPA's climate rules, including emission limits for power plants and stricter fuel requirements for vehicles. - This is the largest deregulation in the history of the United States, says EPA director Lee Zeldin. Trump has called climate change a hoax Trump already tried during his first term to weaken or dismantle parts of the US's climate regulations. The American president has previously called climate change \"the biggest hoax\" ever invented by man. - The carbon footprint is a hoax invented by people with evil intentions, and it points the way to total destruction, he said in a speech to the UN General Assembly last year. The new decision, which is expected to be announced later this week, removes requirements for measuring, reporting, certifying and complying with federal emission standards for motor vehicles. Also associated control programs, credit systems and reporting requirements for the industry are to be abolished, according to the administration. However, the change does not apply to rules for emissions from power plants and other stationary sources, such as oil and gas facilities. But overturning the original decision could pave the way for those rules to be dismantled as well, writes The Wall Street Journal. The criticism: Could endanger millions of lives The fossil fuel industry is expected to be the big winner - which has long opposed federal climate regulations.

The countries receive a score between 0 and 100 – where higher scores mean less corruption.\n\nThis year, Denmark, Finland and Singapore top the list, while South Sudan, Somalia and Venezuela end up at the bottom. Sweden gets 80 points, which is a clear drop from 89 ten years ago. Three areas stand out According to Transparency International Sweden, there are three areas that particularly affect Sweden's results. Organized crime with infiltration and illicit influence poses a serious threat to welfare systems. - It is about organized crime with infiltration, unauthorized influence, extortion and the like. Where companies are used as criminal tools, for example, says Ulrik Åshuvud.\n\nIn addition, Sweden lags behind in transparency and control in public procurement, where several cases of pure corruption have been noticed. - There is a lot of money in procurement. These are large public resources. Over a trillion, i.e. a thousand billion, is procured for in public Sweden today, says Ulrik Åshuvud.\n\nFinally, conflicts of interest are raised, where the ability to refrain from participating in decisions is questioned. - The third thing that we usually talk about is conflicts of interest, that is, the ability to take a step back and realize that maybe you shouldn't be part of the decision-making process or that you shouldn't influence certain decisions, says Ulrik Åshuvud. Political integrity questioned Before the 2022 election, Kalla revealed the facts that five out of eight parties in the Riksdag were prepared to receive secret contributions to the election campaign, which may have affected Sweden's position. - That made us change our direction quite a lot.

According to the indictment, he threatened the girlfriend to send a former client on her. The woman testifies that he says his clients will do \"anything\" for him, gave her the name of a convicted felon and threatened to have a \"quick talk\" with her. Recorded the conversation The lawyer also threatened to counter-report the woman for rape if she went ahead with a police report, something she recorded with the phone: \"You say you're going to report me for rape,\" she says in the recording. \"Yes, I will have to,\" he replies. When asked why he needs it, he replies that he has to \"protect himself\". \"Okay, so you protect yourself. There's no reason to report anyone, is it?

It was when he died that a statue in a park outside the hotel became a pilgrimage site for grieving fans.  In a bizarre dispute over the years, two rival gangs of Jackson lovers emerged who claimed the makeshift monument as theirs. They tore down each other's tributes in nocturnal raids. But for the next few days, the Jackson gang will be allowed to continue their rivalry out of sight. The monument is located within the security zone for the annual security conference in Munich. Kristersson and three ministers on site Prime Minister Kristersson is coming from Sweden with three ministers. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is there, of course, along with around 60 other leaders, such as Ukraine's Zelensky. That J.D. Vance not attending has raised many questions. Does that mean the Trump administration has decided to lower the temperature?  Extending a \"We Are the World\"-like olive branch to European leaders? Or will Secretary of State Marco Rubio give an equally confrontational speech? The so-called peace plan for Ukraine will be discussed. The so-called cease-fire in Gaza will be dissected. The so-called arrest of Venezuela's Maduro will be criticized, at least somewhat quietly, and the so-called negotiations on the future of Greenland will be high on the agenda. A circus even outside the hotel Outside the congress, we can expect a Jackson-like circus. Hundreds of thousands of exiled Iranians are expected to demonstrate Saturday against the country's rule, and the son of Iran's last shah will speak.  Thousands of Ukrainians – as well as opponents of continued support for Ukraine – will also be out in the streets. Around 5,000 police officers are on site. But above all, all numbers will be analyzed down to the smallest detail. Will this be another nail in the coffin for the Western alliance? Or it gets a respite after some tough ones",

On Thursday, he was sentenced to prison for serious accounting offenses against his denial, which TV4 Nyheterna reported on. Emanuel Karlsten, journalist and chairman of the Media Academy, believes that the verdict can have several positive effects. - This may put an end to the circus that has been. By the \"circus\" he refers to the influencer market on platforms such as YouTube and Tiktok, where content creators have made a lot of money on, what it seemed, completely their own terms. \"The Internet is not a total free zone\" Karlsten believes that this sentence, together with the sentence against Christofer \"Crippa\" Lundström, can help set the boundaries in the YouTube world. - These are two examples of how the internet is not a total free zone, but an arena where influencers must play by the same rules as everyone else. He believes that the judges will become warning examples for future content creators. - There will surely be more judgments of this type. The influencer market has been the wild west for a long time. It may be easy to believe that you live in a parallel universe with an audience of millions, but you live in the real world. - Now there will be a reference. In both Pontus and Chrippa's case, it has been a matter of a lack of basic accounting skills. It will be easier to refer to these two judgments in the future. \"Not a world for him\" Furthermore, Emanuel Karlsten believes that the verdict is positive for Pontus Rasmusson personally. - It is obvious that this is not a world for him. He hasn't been able to handle it. He made sexualized content for his child audience, an obvious misstep. Then he doesn't get his basic paperwork in order and is now in prison.

The EU now recommends that member states offer screening from the age of 50, but in Sweden the starting age is still 60. The National Board of Health and Welfare justifies its decision by saying that there is a lack of sufficient scientific evidence that screening between the ages of 50 and 59 would reduce mortality, and that there is a lack of staff and the risk of unequal care. - We don't understand how the National Board of Health and Welfare has thought here, says Birger Pålsson, docent and chief physician. He participated in the National Board of Health and Welfare's expert group that recommended starting screening at the age of 50. He estimates that between 50 and 100 people in the age group 50–59 per year could be saved if screening were introduced earlier. - What we have criticized very harshly is that there is a large amount of international scientific reports that unanimously show this. The National Board of Health and Welfare has not reviewed the modern scientific literature. We were only tasked with reviewing four articles and they are a little old at this point. But paradoxically, most of them also recommend starting at age 50, says Pålsson. Spotted a lump Lotta Hammar was diagnosed at the age of 53, by which time the cancer had already spread. She says that the symptoms were unclear and that she first suspected menopause. - I thought: I'm tired, it's menopause. I'm getting rounder, it's menopause. I blamed it all on: It must be the menopause. It wasn't in my world that it would be something, she says in Efter fem. It wasn't until she discovered a lump the size of a tennis ball sticking out of the left side of her stomach that she checked it out. By then she had been suffering from fatigue and other symptoms for a year. - It had gone so far that I had colon cancer that had spread metastases. So it had gone way too far.

So thick that Ylva von Wright and a friend took on a challenge: to get as close to Sweden as possible on cross-country skates. - We guessed that we would come across a chute with open water, but we wanted to see how far we could go, says Ylva von Wright to TV4 Nyheterna. Ylva and the friend, who are studying to become wilderness guides, had time to get about eight kilometers out on the water before they started to encounter ice banks. The first embankment was still, but a couple of hundred meters out they heard the sound of embankments moving. - We got to experience a fantastic natural phenomenon. What I like about the ice that makes it so fascinating is that you can never plan anything ahead of time because the conditions can change so quickly. \"Risk of being separated from land\" According to SMHI, ice dams can form when the ice is pressed against land or other larger blocks of ice. For this, however, it is required that the ice is thicker than 15-20 centimeters.  The flakes that form the dykes are not usually frozen together, and Ylva and her friend became aware of this when the ice began to crack a little further out. Even the innermost dike began to move over time. - There was a risk that we would end up on an ice floe and be separated from the coast, so it was best to turn around. You must be aware of the risks and respect nature when you go out on the ice. However, they never felt any direct concern. - Since we were in the archipelago, we were quite close to islands, so it didn't feel like we were that far out, says Ylva von Wright. Had food for two days Since the plan was to get as close to the Swedish coast as possible, Ylva von Wright and her friend had really tickled themselves. In addition to the usual equipment of ice spikes, throwing line and dry clothes packed in waterproof sacks, they carried food for two days and four liters of water each. Did you think you would reach Sweden? - No, it was more of a fun idea. You would have needed a packraft to get over the chute. At certain times of the day you can cross the gutter",

He says that he often felt misunderstood as to why he was so absent. - They didn't understand how tough it was trying to support the family, how expensive everything is and how hard it is to make an action film.  - But at the same time, they probably miss that they didn't really know their father, says Dolph Lundgren. The daughter: \"He had his own demons\" Greta Lundgren grew up in Spain with her mother and older sister Ida and felt very abandoned as a child. Now, when Greta is older, she can understand the choices her father made. - I understand that he needed to do that and I think he had his own demons. He needed to be away working. It was good for him. He probably knew it wasn't good that he was with us every day. He wanted to spare us from that, so he stayed away.  When Dolph Lundgren started going to therapy as a 50-year-old, he decided to repair the relationship with his two daughters and apologize for how absent he had been. - It was when I was around 50 myself that I started to come to grips with my own trauma from my childhood. It reflects on how I behaved in life. I had a very tough upbringing with my father who was very violent towards me, he says.

  "bb609c44a066babb45dfbd394fefa5ac5bbb120f": "In large parts of northern Europe and North America, January this year has been colder than normal. In Sweden, temperature deficits were noted throughout the country, especially in the northern parts, where in places it was down to eight degrees colder than normal.  - You must also distinguish between weather and climate. We have cold weather right now. But the climate is warmer and is warming up, says meteorologist Peter Kondrup. Jet streams are affected by climate change At the same time as the cold has taken hold in Sweden, South America and Australia have been affected by heat waves and fires. Peter Kondrup explains that the jet streams, which normally move across the Northern Hemisphere, have become slower and more elongated because the polar regions are warming faster than the equator. This leads to larger and slower oscillations, which can produce both colder and warmer periods than normal.  - There can be very large but slow, tough swings. It is an effect of climate change, of global warming. \"We have a bad memory\" The past twelve years have been the warmest globally, and 2025 was the third warmest year to date. Although this year's January is perceived as cold, it is a mild winter in a longer historical perspective.  - We experience January 2026 as very cold, but compare it to the war winters of the 1940s, then it appears as a pale copy. It was really cold then. Or in the 80s.  For the past 20 years, we have experienced unusually mild winters in Sweden, which may have made us forget how cold it can actually be in winter. - We feel that it is cold and it is a little colder than it has been in a few years. Our memory is quite short. We've gotten used to this global warming, and when it gets a little colder than normal, we think it's freezing cold, says Peter Kondrup.",

There she was accused of theft because she had brought food waste home - and was fired.  - I was completely speechless and thought it was a joke. It came out of nowhere, I hadn't even been told.  Marie enjoyed her work very well and describes it as a shock when the news came - two days before her 50th birthday.  - I decided then and there that it wasn't right. You shouldn't behave that way. Sued the employer Marie sued her employer Skurup Municipality a year and a half ago. Her representative Bo Villner believes that the employer's action was disproportionate and believes that there were other solutions to the situation.  - Our opinion is that it is a trivial incident. There's no reason to believe she wouldn't have stopped if only she had been asked. Why an employer chooses to do so is difficult to know, he believes.  - It can be due to several things. You can have prestige behind it or you dislike someone and want to get rid of them. But this is a bit like cracking nuts with a sledgehammer.

To this day, Marie has not received any explanation as to why she was not given a warning or notice. - If they had told me to stop it, of course I would have done it. Now she hopes her case can help others in similar situations. - I stand up for myself and maybe this can support someone else too.

It is the sixth flight of Ariane 6, but the first with four boosters – a configuration known as Ariane 64. The rocket can now lift about 21.6 tonnes into low orbit, more than double that of previous versions.  The goal of today's launch is to place 32 satellites into orbit, as part of Amazon's rollout of a satellite-based internet system.  European competitiveness in space Ariane 6 is developed to give Europe independent and competitive access to space, the Swedish Space Agency writes on its blog. The version has a longer nose cone than before and is the largest Ariane 6 to date. The rocket is 62 meters, equivalent to a high-rise building with 20 floors. The increased capacity means that larger and heavier loads can be launched at the same time, which is crucial when the number of satellites in orbit is rapidly increasing. Clear Swedish contributions Sweden contributes to the Ariane 6 program via the European Space Agency ESA.  The company GKN Aerospace in Trollhättan develops and manufactures, among other things, nozzles and turbines for the rocket's engines.  \"The launch marks an important step for Europe's space transport and shows how European cooperation, with contributions from several countries, strengthens Europe's ability to reach and use space,\" writes the Swedish Space Agency.",

Rönning resident Patrik Fransson has made it to Stockholm to attend. - I feel that I want to be here to show respect for the family, he says. He hopes that the funeral will be an opportunity for people to come together. - I see quite a lot of hatred and strong emotions. I think it is good that people can come into contact with each other and share feelings together and unite in love, he says. \"Hope they can move on\" Delmon Haffo, a moderate municipal politician in Salem, is also present, but more as a concerned Rönningebo than as a politician, he says.\n\n- For me, it is very important to show support to the family and everyone involved and to show that society is behind them, he says. He didn't know My personally, but knew who she was. They had several mutual friends. - I am above all here because I was touched by something incredible that this could happen in Rönninge, he says. - I hope it will be a nice end to the family's grief work. I hope that they get the opportunity to move on and that we get a church filled with love. The family's statement: \"The loss is bottomless\" My's family does not want to talk to the press in connection with the funeral, but yesterday they shared this statement: We want to thank everyone who has shown us warmth, care and support. It means a lot to us. Our beloved daughter, My, loved sunsets, seas and open horizons. She was curious and brave and stood firm in her convictions, with an obvious respect for others. My spoke more about the world than about herself and never gave up on what she believed in.

But the court states that he was aware that he was running a business subject to bookkeeping and that he was completely indifferent to whether the bookkeeping met the requirements.

The next day, her brother Andreas Törnkvist reported her missing. A large search effort was launched, Missing People was called in and over 200 people volunteered to participate in the search. Three months after she disappeared, she was found dead in a lake, wrapped in a blanket in a garbage bag - at the same time her 56-year-old Juha Marttila was arrested. Today he was sentenced to 18 years in prison for murder and violation of grave peace. - The district court has, after an examination of a series of circumstantial evidence, concluded that it is beyond reasonable doubt that the man killed the woman and then moved the body in the way that the prosecutor has claimed. Other perpetrators can be excluded, says court president Anne Olsson.  Got an early tip about the roommate In the investigation, it appears that the police had been keeping an eye on Juha Marttila for some time. Relatives had stated that they got a strange feeling when they talked to him. Missing People also alerted the police to Juha Marttila. After searching for a week, they advised the police that they wanted to do an internal search. Then he had contacted an acquaintance to move furniture in the home. The partner must also have stated that they had recently broken up. \"Missing People got bad vibes from this. First, that they had broken up just before the disappearance, but also that he was so careful to move under furniture right after Missing People's phone call,\" writes the police who received the tip.  Had similar garbage bags at home The same kind of garbage bags that she was found in were also found in Juha Marttila's residence. The fibers that were in the blanket were also found in his car and on thresholds in the home.  The prosecutor said that they had extensive technical evidence and that several interrogations pointed to Juha Marttila as having committed the murder. He had strangled her to death and then moved the body and left it in the lake. Juha Marttila has always denied it",

The shutdown, which lasted a total of seven hours, meant, among other things, that no planes could take off from the international airport in the city. The reason behind the shutdown is that drones belonging to Mexican drug cartels have crossed the border, says US Transport Minister Sean Duffy on X. Used super weapon The US responded by resorting to a weapon they had never used before, reports the Reuters news agency. According to sources with insight, it is a kind of anti-drone weapon with direct energy technology - i.e. the same type of technology that the US is suspected of having used in connection with the strike against Venezuela's now deposed President Nicolás Maduro. Neither the Pentagon nor AeroVironment, the company behind the drone, have commented on the data. When the information about the drone came from Mexico, the FAA initially said that the airport in El Paso would remain closed for up to ten days.  Delayed Valentine's Day trip Two people affected by the stop were Jorge Rueda and Yamilexi Meza who were scheduled to fly to Portland, Oregon for a Valentine's Day trip. - I am happy that ten days became only two hours for us, Jorge Rueda told AP after their flight was rebooked.

  "28d727c8b92e9ac0fbfd1ddacf2a7fc1cef2713f": "Foul-smelling packages have been placed along Finland's eastern border to stop rabies from entering the country. The packages contain fish-scented baits with vaccines, specially formulated for wild predators such as foxes and raccoons. The background is reports of rabies cases in the Moscow region of Russia. Despite that, the situation is calm, according to the experts. - Bait vaccines have been distributed every year since the early 1990s. It is a proven and effective method to prevent the spread of rabies, says Tiina Nokireki, senior researcher at the Swedish Food Agency, to the Finnish Ilta Sanomat.  Rabies-free for 30 years Finland has been classified as rabies-free for around 30 years. The vaccines are being distributed across the southeastern border, which is considered the most likely route for the infection to enter from Russia. Last fall, around 180,000 vaccine doses were released in the area. But despite the outbreak in Moscow, the risk has not increased, emphasizes Nokireki. - Vaccines have also been distributed on the Russian side, and besides, the distance is long. Animals don't move such long distances, she tells the newspaper. Do not touch the baits - vaccinate your pets The vaccine baits smell really bad and should be left alone. If humans touch them, animals may avoid them due to human weathering. It is also not advisable to come into contact with the vaccine solution inside the bait. At the same time, the authorities remind us of the importance of vaccinating pets. - Dogs and cats should be vaccinated against rabies throughout the country, says Nokireki. Should rabies still reach Finland, it is more likely that the infection will first spread to pets and then on to humans - rather than humans being infected directly by wild animals, according to the Finnish Food Agency.",

The percentage of unemployed has decreased to 6.8 percent at the end of January compared to 7.2 percent a year ago, according to the statistics.  Compared to previous months, however, there is a marginal increase in the number of unemployed. - We often see a certain increase around the turn of the year, so that figure is no surprise. If we take seasonal patterns into account, we instead see a continued reduction in unemployment, and that for the sixth month in a row, says Eva Samakovlis, director of analysis at Arbetsförmedlingen. That county is the best Norrbotten county has the country's lowest unemployment (3.9 percent). Skåne and Södermanland's counties are in the second bracket, with unemployment rates of 8.9 and 8.5 percent respectively. Youth unemployment is also decreasing. In total, roughly 40,000 young people aged 18 to 24 were registered with the Employment Service at the end of January. This is a decrease of just over 4,000 compared to the same period last year. At the same time as the percentage of the unemployed is decreasing, the Swedish Employment Agency sees an increase in the long-term unemployed.

In Munich, where the annual security conference was taking place in parallel, German police said around 250,000 people took part in the demonstration. Reza Pahlavi himself attended the security conference and spoke, among other things, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. \n\nPahlavi also attended the demonstration where he gave a speech. - We tell all grieving families that they are not alone. As a child, father, husband and brother, I understand the pain of the grieving families. Not a day has passed without me shedding tears, but these tears give me energy, he told the large crowd at the venue. US Senator Lindsey Graham also spoke at the demonstration and expressed support for the Iranian people's struggle for democracy. \n\n- Help is on the way, he said during his speech. An estimated 350,000 people gathered in Toronto and about the same number attended in Los Angeles. In Britain, police reported that 50,000 people took part in the demonstrations. The participants chanted slogans against the Iranian regime and expressed support for the relatives of the thousands of people killed during the protests in Iran more than a month ago.\n\nThousands also gathered in Stockholm and Gothenburg to demonstrate against the Iranian regime.",

  "ce6a0996875e9eb6645862e487fbf690d8be574c": "Every season, an average of 1,650 children over the course of a year need hospital care due to RS virus infection. In a country with good healthcare, it is not a fatal disease, but worried parents come to the children's emergency room with babies who have difficulty breathing when the cough, fever and phlegm hit. Small children's airways are more seriously affected by the RS virus, so they may need breathing support in the form of oxygen. When small children get sick with a high fever, they may find it difficult to eat, and then they get a tube down their stomach with nutrition, says Susanne Strömdahl, infectious disease doctor and investigator at the Norwegian Public Health Agency. The very youngest children, who are only a few months old, can sometimes suffer from breathing pauses, so-called apneas. Hope for a turning point Now there is hope for a turning point, which could lead to a significantly reduced burden on children's healthcare during the winter months - and reduced suffering for the very smallest. Since September 10 last year, newborns are offered an injection with antibodies against the RS virus. A majority of parents have agreed. It is not surprising, but it is very gratifying that the majority choose to accept with the big win for the smallest children to be protected for the first winter season. Is it revolutionary? Yes, it is based on the international data we see reported, says Susanne Strömdahl. Not one hundred percent. She describes the medicine as safe. So far, there have been five reports of side effects in Sweden, and in those cases it has mainly been a fine dotted rash or redness and swelling at the injection site. The antibodies provide good, but not 100% protection against serious illness. After the treatment began to be offered, the Public Health Agency has only received reports of a few children who received antibodies and still suffered RS virus infection. We expect a large protective effect. But in this situation, we are just at the beginning of the spread of infection. We had the start of the season in week five. The advice to protect babies from meeting cold people outside is approached",

Are they a natural part of the festive season or do they just cause unnecessary suffering to animals and people? On February 17, the defense committee will consider several received motions concerning bans or restrictions on fireworks. Before that, 13 organizations have come together and written an open letter urging the committee to take the motions seriously and consider a total ban on fireworks for private individuals.  Can suffer lifelong hearing damage The letter has been signed by several animal welfare organizations, but also by blue light personnel, including the Swedish Police Association.\n\n- Today, we mainly have hearing damage that is sometimes lifelong and that you can't do anything about. We don't have, pepper pepper, no cops that have had any of these pyrotechnics in the face or anything like that. But on the day it happens, considering how potent these fireworks are, we run the risk of even worse injuries or death, says Björn Johnsson, regional head security representative of the Swedish Police Association. In a survey among the members of the Police Association, 13 percent of police officers on external duty answered that they had been fired upon with fireworks. The industry does not believe that bans solve problems The industry does not believe that a ban would have solved this type of problem. \n\n- It would have reduced some ordinary fireworks and not least it would have reduced for those who are law abiding and already behave themselves. On the other hand, the rather large part of illegal fireworks imports had certainly increased. It's already big and it wouldn't disappear, unfortunately, says Martin Hildeberg, treasurer of Sweden's Pyrotechnic Industry Association.\n\nBut Björn Johnsson of the Swedish Police Association does not agree that a ban would mainly affect the law-abiding.\n\n- I think we have passed that stage. About 13 percent of our police officers feel that this is a problem and ambulance and rescue personnel",

The White House blamed the release of the video on a staff member, and it was deleted after a while. In a podcast, Obama is asked to comment on US discourse, and host Brian Tyler Cohen brings up the monkey video. It is important to remember that a majority of the American population finds this behavior deeply troubling, Obama said in the podcast, according to the BBC. He also says that it is a kind of \"clown show\" that takes place on social media and on television. There seems to be no shame in this among people who used to feel they had to have some sort of decency.",

  "c37de03fc58e55c3246925a74de56a370dddb21a": "The text was written during World War II by William \"Wild Bill\" Donovan, head of the Office of Strategic Services which later became the CIA. The manual was published in 2008. In the last month, it has been downloaded nearly 60,000 times and is now the fifth most popular e-book on Project Gutenberg, an American literature project that works to make available literature that is not covered by copyright. Small actions slow down the system The manual describes so-called \"simple sabotage\". It is about everyday behaviors that, if repeated, can make it difficult for a bureaucracy to function. Among the advice is to: Give long speeches and drag out meetings.  Bring up side issues and discuss details unnecessarily.  \"Misunderstanding\" instructions, asking many questions and delaying answers. It is also suggested to play dumb, be as annoying and argumentative as possible without breaking rules, as well as to stop talking when representatives of the regime enter a room. The purpose, according to the authors, is to make the work of the police and security services more difficult, but also to give ordinary people a way to show resistance to decisions they perceive as unacceptable. Attention in today's USA Why the manual has gone viral right now is unclear. According to the online newspaper 404 Media, the interest coincides with a period of unrest and change in the American workplace, especially among government employees. Questions of loyalty, reorganizations and new demands on employees have become more common in a more polarized political climate. During Donald Trump's time in power, discussions about the role of the state and the independence of the authorities have again taken place in the public debate. In that context, the old CIA manual has received new attention among some readers. On a large online forum for government employees, one of the most-read posts is headlined: \"To my colleagues, especially veterans: we are at war.\" There, the manual is shared primarily as a historical document – ​​and as a basis for discussion.",

The 20-year-old from Örby in Västergötland promised more energy after Friday's rehearsal and now it is clear that her contribution has gone home with the viewers. She debuted with the contribution \"Hate you so much\" last year, won her preliminary competition and finished in twelfth and last place in the final. This year, Ludvigsson describes his contribution as a little more cocky, more mature and darker. Favorite love song Hip-hop duo Medina predicted their chances as good with the contribution \"Viva l'amor\" on Valentine's Day. It also went down well with the audience, the contribution received the most votes. Made up of veterans Sami Rekik and Ali Jammali, Medina were favorites from the start. The duo has previously come in third and second place in the Melodifestivalen and has stated during the week that it would be like a \"fairy tale\" if they win the entire competition this year. As recently as January, Sami Rekik took a timeout due to physical and mental exhaustion. However, it is not something that has been noticed during the rehearsals this week. With a massive confetti rain of red hearts, a torchlight parade and dancers with maximum energy, Medina has lived up to expectations. The youngest participant in the qualifiers, Eva Jumatate, took third place and thus goes to the finals with the entry \"Selfish\". She is the youngest participant in Melodifestivalen 2026 and has previously said that it feels nerve-wracking to make her debut, but that the fact that she is participating in her hometown of Kristianstad has calmed her nerves. When Jumatate participated in Talent as a ten-year-old, she moved Bianca Ingrosso to tears. Eight years later, she once again performs a ballad that has proven to be a hit on TV sofas.

In the historic setting, surrounded by snow and sun, 26 people chose to get married – some before God and others before the state.  Wanted to create something new Elina Kouthoofd, who is the project manager at Skansen, says that the idea of ​​a winter wedding was sparked by the desire to create something new based on the popular summer concept.  - We run drop-in weddings in the summer and have done so for ten years. So we saw before 2026 that Valentine's Day was on a Saturday. Then we thought: Shouldn't we test the drop-in concept, but in the winter? Then there was a winter wedding on February 14, she says.  The atmosphere during Valentine's Day at Skansen is described as magical and filled with love.  - So much love in the air and in every place. It's magical, says Elina Kouthoofd.  In Seglora church from the 18th century, Tina Aandalen and Karl Aspengren got married. With around fifty guests, a priest and lively music, the couple exchanged rings in the historic building. However, the courtship took place just under two months ago.  - Karl proposed on the morning of Christmas Eve. We felt: Now we're driving! Yet we have waited over ten years for it to happen.

Malmer Stenergard points out that the more conciliatory tone from the US will not necessarily last over time. - Rubio extended a hand and said that you want to cooperate with Europe, you want things to go well for Europe. But the collaboration must take place where it is good for us. - In the conversations I have had with him, it has always been very constructive. However, other representatives have sounded different. We all remember the speech in Munich last year and Trump's statements about Greenland Focus on \"white Europe\" Dag Blanck, senior professor of North American studies at Uppsala University, believes that Rubio's speech is strongly influenced by American domestic politics. - This is a speech that speaks to Trump's core voters to a great extent, says Blanck.  He points out that minority groups such as African Americans, Latinos, Asians and indigenous peoples are completely excluded in Rubio's picture of Europe. According to Blanck, Rubio's message was a clear nationalist vision: - He criticized immigration and advocated a Europe that strengthens itself rather than driving global cooperation. He mentioned his roots in Spain and Italy, but not Cuba, and barely spoke at all about democracy or human rights. The focus was instead on Western European culture as a basis for cooperation, says Blanck. - You can say that it is a very narrow view of Europe, where it is defined as \"white Europe\", and where other groups are excluded from the picture. There is a clear connection to domestic politics in the United States.  Independence in focus European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called Rubio's speech \"very reassuring\", but pointed out that other representatives in the administration have a tougher tone. - Europe has no other choice but to become independent.

He therefore has to walk along the E12 – where the cars drive at 90 kilometers per hour.  - It's scary. When trucks come, I feel like I'm going to be run over, he says.  The parents Johanna and Krister have appealed the decision to the administrative court, which assesses the stretch as dangerous for traffic. Even so, Hjalmar is not entitled to a taxi because they live too close to the pick-up point.  - We want the children to be treated fairly and here their safety is not taken into account, says Hjalmar's mother Johanna Sundin.  Getting help from a private actor Previously, they went into the forest to avoid the road, but now a private actor has offered to pick up Hjalmar for free. The family has been told by the municipality that the school bus would cost SEK 250,000 a year, but they consider that to be irrelevant to the discussion.  - I, who work in healthcare, know that you don't say \"now it costs 300,000 for us to replace your hip\", says Johanna Sundin. The parents have lived in Forsmark for 17 years. The municipality is now working to attract more people to the area, but the family believes that it is difficult to motivate other families with children to move there. - You don't want to say: \"come and live here in Forsmark, but your child will have to follow a European path\", says Hjalmar's father Krister Näslund. Parental responsibility applies to the Chairman of the Municipal Board in Storuman municipality, Ulrik Dahlgren (S), says that the decision rests with civil servants and administrative law. He is familiar with the route and admits that there are risks with the proximity to the road.   - This is a road that we all drive many times, so you know the route itself. He explains that parental responsibility applies, which means that it is up to the parents to follow Hjalmar to the bus stop. He cannot offer any suggestions for solutions to Hjalmar's school transport and regrets the dissatisfaction. - Yes, we're never happy when someone threatens to move when we take",

Russian authorities have claimed he died of natural causes, but the Russian version is contested. Now a new investigation shows that he was poisoned with epibatidine – an extremely potent poison extracted from the skin of South American poison dart frogs and many times stronger than morphine. The symptoms include paralysis, severe convulsions and respiratory arrest and greatly increased blood pressure. - We have confirmed that a deadly toxin was found in Alexei Navalny's body. \"Only the Russian government had the opportunity, motive and opportunity to use it against him in prison,\" said British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper. Great Britain: Russia despises its citizens The report is presented at a joint press meeting with all five countries' foreign ministers, but also Navalny's widow, during the security conference in Munich.  - That is why we are here today, to shine a spotlight on the Kremlin's barbaric attempts to silence Alexei Navalny. To show that the Russian government shows contempt for its citizens and is prepared to use this deadly poison, says Cooper. According to Sweden's Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard, experts from the five countries have been able to establish that Navalny was poisoned in Russian captivity. - With the help of experts from all five countries, we have established that he was poisoned by epibatidine. Only Russia could administer the poison because he was in captivity. Most likely, it was the FSB that was behind it, she says. Navalny's widow: No longer just words The investigation will now be handed over to the OPCW, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, to increase pressure on Russia. - We will hold Russia accountable in the OPCW and spread knowledge about the use of this highly potent poison to prevent its use again, says Malmer Stenergard.

  "81f8b7180524c423aa529b26750e13d8b44c8c7a": "On Friday, the security conference began in Munich, with several world leaders in attendance. Ahead of this year's conference, the organizers have chosen to highlight the \"elephant in the room\", namely how the US's role in the world is changing and how well-established collaborations are threatened. Last year, US Vice President JD Vance shocked when he gave his speech with a harsh tone towards Europe. This year, the tone was considerably more accommodating. During Saturday's speech, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized that Europe and the US belong together and highlighted the importance of common security. But the new security situation has caused the Nordic countries to act. - One way to strengthen our security is to merge military units on the northern flank, says Magnus Christiansson, senior lecturer in military science at the University of Defense. - The idea is to send a signal to Russia: you cannot divide us. If a war breaks out on the northern flank, we are already united from the start. Getting more intense – because of the USA Christiansson explains that the Nordic countries are thinking about what other complements they can have to their NATO membership and how they can use it to strengthen their security regionally. This as a result of the US's changed policy and with the threats against Denmark - It is a process that has existed before but is now entering a more intensive stage, he says. The Nordic defense cooperation is today based on the Nordic Defense Cooperation, Nordefco, which means various cooperations that have existed with roots going back to the Cold War. In 2024, the Nordic countries signed an agreement on a joint defense concept – something that can now be intensified. Different experiences One challenge is the different historical experiences of the Nordic countries. - What is a lie in Copenhagen is the truth in Helsinki and that poses a problem. If Russia were to make a push, it would be viewed in completely different ways in the Nordic countries, says Christiansson. - But at the same time, I think this is being done to deter Russia and that is probably one of them",

At the same time, the annual security conference is taking place in Munich, where the exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi is calling for global demonstrations against the regime on Saturday, focusing on the big cities of Munich, Los Angeles and Toronto. \"Iranians abroad and freedom-loving people around the world, February 14 is the global day of action in solidarity with Iran's Sun and Lion Revolution, a day to take to the streets and force the international community to take urgent, practical measures in support of the Iranian people,\" he wrote in a post on X. Exile Iranians from around the world, including Sweden, are now joining the demonstration. Several buses have departed from Gothenburg, Malmö and Stockholm to the giant demonstration that is expected in Munich.  Want to show unity On board one of the buses from Malmö is the Swedish-Iranian Fariba Boustanchi, who traveled for over 14 hours to be the voice of the Iranian people. - The Iranian regime has systematically violated human rights, imprisoned and executed political opponents and suppressed women for several decades. Due to the ongoing and serious situation in Iran, we have gathered here to be the voice of the Iranian people, she says on board the bus on the way to Munich. - We must show the outside world that we agree with each other both outside and inside Iran. We want to draw the world's attention to Iran, she continues. Fariba is one of many Iranians who hope for regime change in Iran. She calls for international support and expresses support for former Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi. - Iranians have expressed very clearly for several years that the Iranian regime is not our representative and that they do not want the mullahs as leaders in Iran. - We demand international recognition of the crown prince as a legitimate representative of Iran.

  "964ca04ff4f7dd3b30a19b9f9a8b1273c7c48c5b": "This year, Saturday does not give the same extra boost as when Valentine's Day falls on a weekday. Saturdays are already popular for restaurant visits, while weekdays usually get a bigger boost from the holiday. \n \nMost of the reservations for the restaurants on Valentine's Day are for two people, but since it is Saturday, larger groups can also show up, which sometimes affects the intimate atmosphere. \n  \n- It can be very intimate and the sound level can be a little lower. But we in the staff usually make sure that everyone feels comfortable and can talk. We joke and sing. It will be nice for everyone here, says Felicia Bonaccorso. Many restaurants fully booked Bonaccorso has been fully booked for several months before Valentine's Day. According to BokaBord, which made a compilation of reservations from 440 restaurants in Stockholm, nearly 70 percent are fully booked during dinner time on Valentine's Day. The booking situation is roughly the same as last year, with an increase of just under two percent. \n  \n- When I was inside myself looking for a free table for two on BokaBord, I saw that there are only 129 restaurants that have a free table tomorrow, compared to 400 restaurants in Stockholm on a normal Saturday, says Peder Dinkelspiel, founder of BokaBord.  Strained financial situation Despite the fact that the booking situation is good, many restaurants continue to have a tough time financially. Many are struggling to repay tax deferrals from the pandemic and guests are spending less than before. \n  \n- The booking situation looks good and it is true. But the notes are smaller.

  "eca31a271892de78316ca12411fa4c04ba9439dc": "According to Rädda Barnen, it is unlikely that the legislators intended that newborn children should be able to be deported when their parents have the right to stay in Sweden. In Emanuel's case, the decision is based on the fact that the rules for so-called track change were changed shortly before his birth - without transitional provisions for families who were already in the country. - I am convinced that no legislator imagined that this could be the consequence. But when many major changes are implemented in a short time, no one has time to review the consequences, says children's rights lawyer Karin Sjömilla. The Prime Minister: \"Sounds unreasonable\" Several leading politicians have reacted to the case. Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson has called the data \"unreasonable\". Even Ebba Busch has described the situation as unreasonable, and Jimmie Åkesson has said that he does not believe there is legal support for deporting an eight-month-old baby. Recently, several high-profile cases have involved children and teenagers who are at risk of deportation. Among other things, the discussion has been about possible exceptions for certain groups, such as so-called high school youth. But point efforts are not enough, says Karin Sjömilla. Save the Children instead calls for a broad review of the legislation at its core, to ensure that the best interests of the child actually have an impact. \"The best interests of the child must be put aside\" Among other things, the possibility to grant a residence permit due to \"particularly painful circumstances\" has been removed and replaced with the significantly more restrictive requirement \"particularly painful reasons\", something which has had major consequences according to Karin Sjömilla. - It is a very strict limitation. At the same time, politics sends the signal that as few as possible should be allowed to stay. This leads to the rules being interpreted narrowly, and then the best interests of the child often have to take a backseat to the principle of regulated immigration, she says. According to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the best interests of the child must be a fundamental starting point in all decisions concerning children. But in practice, that principle does not have enough impact, says Karin Sjömil",

I will never be able to do this, I thought. He didn't get in with the car and had to get in through a small crack.  - I barely got through the door. Took help via Facebook Leo is wary of physical exertion due to heart problems and therefore took help via the Facebook group Anslagstavlan Österlen. Shortly afterwards, an ambulance rolled into the lot. - I thought it was Särbo who had called as a precaution. But it wasn't like that. It turned out that the ambulance nurses Annette Lindelöf and David Sunesson had seen Leo's appeal and since they had time to spare – they rushed out to help. - They jumped out of the car and said \"Hurry up, give us each a shovel\" and then they started bouncing like two snow blowers, says Leo Selmerhagen.  \"Shows empathy\" Since the paramedics were nearby, there was no hesitation in going there.  - For us, it was obvious to help.

  "83836fa6f8cac76367545deb94cc39232188587b": "This ski season, there have been several serious incidents at the Swedish mountain destinations. \nIn December, a 20-year-old man died in one of the ski slopes in Åre, and at the beginning of January, a 45-year-old man died in Björnrike in Vemdalen. What caused the fatal accidents is currently being investigated, but the events have shed light on the state of safety on the slopes at the ski resorts. \n\nIn Lofsdalen there have been no serious incidents this winter, but there have been some incidents where skiers have injured themselves on the slopes.  - There have been a few knee injuries and wrist injuries. says Jonny Larsson, site manager in Lofsdalen.\n\n How do you work to make the slopes as safe as possible? \n\n- We put nets and mattresses on obstacles so the skiers don't injure themselves, and we inform them that we have low-speed zones through signs on the slopes, says Jonny Larsson, site manager in Lofsdalen. Many have been injured on the slopes When TV4 talks to holidaymakers on the ski slope, several of them say that they have at some point injured themselves on the ski slope or have friends or relatives who have been affected. - My daughter was riding and was inattentive and destroyed her knee, not that it broke completely, but got a stretch on both ligaments and cruciate ligaments, says Anders Börjesson. But there are things to keep in mind to reduce the risk of injury on the ski slopes. For example, using a helmet and other protection, having the right settings on your ski bindings, adjusting your speed and training your core and leg strength before you go on a skiing holiday. - I think a bit like this: No one goes to a cross-country competition without training first. The same should apply to downhill skiing. That you have trained your muscles a little before you go to the mountains and go slaloming or snowboarding for a whole week, says ski instructor Stella Elm.",

In the past, those who have stood the longest have stood for 15 hours and 49 minutes, but now the goal is to play for an entire day without dropping the ball. The current world record of 16 hours and 2 seconds was set by two people in the Netherlands.   Practical challenges Playing table tennis for 24 hours requires some preparation. Fredrik Nilsson says that this time they have a special plan for toilet visits. - We will run with the classic adult diaper this time. We can't pee ourselves in live broadcast, he says in Efter fem. - Even if you have Northern Europe's best bladder, you have to drive 24 hours, so better to be safe than sorry, adds Emil Ohlsson. But it is only number one that is relevant, the duo underlines. - Nothing else comes up, says Fredrik Nilsson. \"It will be too boring\" The player duo tells us that there will be officials on site in Västerås. During the record attempt, they will receive viewer questions and talk a lot, something that will be important to keep the concentration up.   - If we hadn't talked to the audience, we would never have managed to set a world record. It will be too boring, simply, to stand with Emil for 24 hours, says Fredrik Nilsson. - Even though we are damn good friends, we get tired of each other too, says Emil Ohlsson. \"Will drive straight into the tile\" The duo are determined to play for 24 hours and in doing so also beat the current record of 16 hours and two seconds.  - We have to take that away from them, says Fredrik.  - That is priority one, but then we will drive straight into the tile, concludes Emil.",

  "523c376baed9a78908a329341fb1ced9029184c5": "This year's winter has been a cold story. For several weeks the temperature has been well below zero. The chilly weather is expected to last. And during Saturday, even lower temperatures are expected, down to minus 37-40 in Gielas, in the Västerbottenfjällen.\n\n- The cold air is already about to swing in from the northeast, because the high pressure is strengthening and taking the cold air with it to the south, says Ulrika Elvgren, TV4 meteorologist. Colder January for a long time January has been colder than normal throughout the country. In Pajala the coldest since the measurements started in 1940. In Karesuando the coldest since 1893. In many places in the Tornedalen January has been among the three coldest that have been measured. \n\n- The coldest so far this year has been minus 40.8 degrees in Gielas on January 4. And here it can be down to 40 degrees this weekend. Last year's lowest temperature in the country was minus 36 degrees, says Ulrika Elvgren. High pressure over Sweden has been blocked The fact that the cold has kept Sweden in a firm grip for so long is because a high pressure over Scandinavia has been blocked. In summer the high pressure causes heat waves, in winter they cause the cold to linger.\n\n- We have had high pressure since January, and right now there is nothing that breaks it down. It's because we don't have any jet streams here, they go by the Mediterranean Sea, where they cause storm Nils, among other things, says Ulrika Elvgren.\n\nAccording to researchers, the fact that the jet streams have lost power is due to the climate changes affecting the Earth's polar regions.\n\n- The jet streams that run in a north-south direction have lost their sting, which allows the cold air to get from the polar regions and south. We would need traction from jet streams to bring up some heat from the south, says Ulrika Elvgren. Chilly for the rest of the month But right now there are no such signs. The cold will last, shows SMHI's long-term forecast. \n\n- It will probably be cold for the rest of the month. And in March, you don't yet see that the jet streams change to any great degree. We have a real winter this year, says Ulrika Elvgren.\n\nBut to last",

In London, fans from all over Europe gather to participate, watch the competitions and meet like-minded people. - Those I have spoken to so far, they say they have been waiting for this for a long period, says Thomas Kvarnkullen, foreign reporter. \"Followed all my life\" Amar Palm is a pokemon enthusiast and has tens of thousands of cards in his collection.  - When I was little, I opened packs with my mother. I have always been a big collector. Pokemon is the only thing that has accompanied me all my life, says Amar Palm in Efter fem. Several of Amar's cards are very valuable. One of his most exclusive cards, a so-called Bubble Mew, can be worth up to SEK 30,000. However, selling the cards is not an option. - I get separation anxiety just from the thought of selling the cards, says Amor Palm. Millions for rare cards The Pokemon trend is not only felt among fans - it is also clearly visible in the market. A unique Pokémon card is currently for sale for over 5 million dollars, equivalent to just over 50 million kroner. The value of the card is due to its unique history and condition and it has never been available in regular packs. - Combined with the fact that you couldn't open it in any pack plus it being a ten makes it the most desirable card in all of Pokémon, says Amar Palm.",

  "efd290df07fed2fa1fcd561d62dbc2d4f5401711": "On Friday, Katja Nyberg took part in the newspaper Kvartal's Friday interview. In the podcast, she says that the Swedish Transport Agency revoked her driver's license because they found a metabolite of cocaine, i.e. a chemical residue, and that it is \"not an active substance\". - Then the question is how it got into my body, says Nyberg. When asked how the residual product could have arisen, she replies: - I have not taken any cocaine. I deny wrongdoing. Nyberg's lawyer has previously used a similar argument. \"For an unknown reason, a rapid test gave a result for cocaine, but only for the metabolite and not the narcotic substance,\" the lawyer wrote in a letter to the Swedish Transport Agency, which TV4 previously reported on. Swedish Medical Examiner's Office: Can only occur if you take cocaine Jimmy Blomqvist Larsson, press officer at the Swedish Medical Examiner's Office, dismisses the reasoning completely. Benzoylecgonine, i.e. the residual product you measure to see if someone has taken cocaine, is classified as a narcotic in itself. If you test positive for that, you are automatically guilty of a drug crime, even if it is not the active substance, he says. In addition, he says that if the metabolite is present in the blood, it always means that you have taken cocaine. - If you've had it in your body, you've had cocaine in your body, says Jimmy Blomqvist Larsson. If benzoylecgonine is found in the body, can it be equated with having used cocaine? - Yes. Could this metabolite occur in some other way than if you took cocaine? - No. Became a political wild It was in the intervening days that Katja Nyberg was stopped by the police after a game accident. The police found a bag of white powder, and she has since been investigated for drunk driving and drug offences. At the end of January, the Swedish Transport Agency revoked her driver's license after drugs were detected in the test results. She has been dismissed from several heavy assignments and became a political wild after the scandal. Katja Nyberg has previously worked as a police officer and was the Sweden Democrats' spokesperson on police issues. During",

According to information to TV4 Nyheterna, the suspect is a principal at a school. The victim, who is a minor, has previously been a student at the same school. The criminal suspicions against the principal are said to have strengthened during the day. - Last night the person was arrested on reasonable suspicion (the lower level of suspicion) and now I have just made the decision that the arrest remains but now on probable grounds, the higher level of suspicion. We have gone through more evidence and the person is heard with his defender, says the prosecutor. Denies crime The suspected sexual crimes must have taken place for about a year and a half, according to the prosecutor. - I cannot comment on how many cases are involved, but there are several cases of rape and it must have taken place during a period from the summer of 2024 to the beginning of this year. The prosecutor confirms that the suspected perpetrator is employed at a school, but does not want to comment on TV4 Nyheter's information that he works as a principal. - The arrested person denies the crime. Now the investigation continues. We will hold further interrogations and carry out technical investigations and a review of technical seizures.

  "0d456ad81dd4a0dad049e3fe425ea57c0bf3142e": "More cases of winter sickness are now being reported in Sweden. The number is expected to continue to increase, according to the Public Health Authority.   - It is quite likely that the peak has not been reached, but it is difficult to know. The vast majority do not seek care for the symptoms and then not everyone is included in the statistics, says Acting State Epidemiologist Erik Sturegård. The winter sickness is caused by calicivirus which is highly contagious and resistant. Hand sanitizer is not enough and it takes a very small amount of the virus to make you sick. - It can also withstand dehydration, which means that you can become infected long after you have come into contact with it.  Easy to confuse with food poisoning Erik Sturegård believes that mouth protection is only recommended if you are exposed to large amounts of viruses, such as in healthcare. A common mistake is to mistake winter sickness for food poisoning. - There are similar symptoms, but with food poisoning you get sick right away and then quickly get well again. But it can be difficult to know, and therefore one should not take chances but assume that it is winter sickness.  The risk of infection is particularly high for families with small children and specifically when cooking. - If you get sick, it is very important that you do not cook for others. If you have sick children, it is important that they stay at home for at least 48 hours after the last bout of vomiting and diarrhoea. More cases than last year The latest increase in cases is in line with the Public Health Agency's forecast. At the moment, the numbers are higher than compared to last year and it is difficult to say when the spread can conceivably slow down.  - It is possible to work to bring the numbers down if we are meticulous about hygiene. The spread usually takes place over a relatively long period and it is greatly influenced by the efforts we make.",

Iran exercises in important straits At the same time, Iran's Revolutionary Guard has begun exercises in the Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf, AFP reports. The aim is to prepare the Guard for \"potential security and military threats\" after the US increased its military presence in the region. The Strait of Hormuz is strategically important. Iranian politicians have repeatedly threatened to block the strait. The US and several European countries have expressed concern that Iran is developing nuclear weapons, which Iran denies.

The result shows that almost all non-prescription products are cheaper online – only 19 products had the same price in both channels. In some cases, the price in store can be more than four times as high as online.  - I think it is very important that everyone knows this big price gap between pharmacy products online and in stores so that you can make a good purchase decision, says Isabella Ahmadi. Big differences between products Among the products that stand out the most in terms of percentage are migraine medicine and medicine for heartburn. A pack of migraine tablets can, for example, cost SEK 20 online but SEK 95 in a store, a difference of 375 percent. Even common medicines such as paracetamol and ibuprofen can be significantly more expensive in stores, especially if they are less well-known brands. Price differences in percentage: When it comes to price differences in kronor, it is above all fever thermometers and food supplements that stand out, as the basic price is already high. For these products, the consumer can save up to SEK 200 by choosing to buy online. Price differences in kroner: \"A very good loophole\" Johan Wallér, CEO of Sweden's Pharmacists' Association, believes that the fierce competition online puts pressure on prices, while the costs of running the business make it difficult for physical stores to match online prices. - It costs money to have shops at central addresses and to employ pharmacists with extensive training. It is no wonder that it is becoming more expensive, he says. One way to get away with lower prices is to order goods online and choose to pick them up in store - often within a couple of hours. - It is a very good loophole. Then you can choose the price level yourself and still get quick access to the product, says Isabella Ahmadi.",

But I hope that we will be able to move forward in a better direction, because we must also remember that the United States is important to us and it is also about a broader relationship than just with the Trump administration, says Foreign Minister Malmer Stenergard. Collective sigh of relief The relationship with the United States has taken up a lot of space in Europe after the winter's Greenland crisis. At this weekend's security policy conference in Munich, European leaders breathed a collective sigh of relief when US Secretary of State Marco Rubio refrained from insulting them in a conciliatory speech that nevertheless contained elements of criticism and demands for new path choices for Europe.  And in tomorrow's foreign declaration, the government's tone will be harsher compared to the year before. Then, in 2025, the government decided that Sweden's and the USA's relations are very good. But this time it will be different, Malmer Stenergard asserts: - I probably won't say that. It is a challenging relationship, but it is also diversified.

  "ab9d1b33410e60c6b75b06bdc2853ea7fdf1c3ce": "Farhood and Sara Masoudi came to Sweden from Iran with their children seven years ago. After the asylum application was rejected, the parents had to stay by changing tracks because they worked as cleaners and in home care. Barely a year ago, however, the possibilities for a change of track were scrapped, and then came the announcement of deportation. 14-year-old Parham Masoudi has lived in Norsjö for half his life, loves to play hockey and speaks Norsjö dialect. - I don't understand why we should be deported. Iran is just a name for me, not my homeland. I could live my whole life in Norsjö, says Parham. \"Dangerous for us to return\" Parham's father Farhood Masoudi says that the family's Christian faith means they cannot return to Iran. - We converted while living in Iran, it is dangerous for us to return, he says. The Masoudi family's deportation notice has sparked interest in Norsjö - one of Sweden's smallest municipalities. The family is considered well-integrated and needed, according to a campaign film in support of the family. - This is the issue that has engaged Norsjö residents the most in all the years I have been a politician. I have been stopped at Ica and Coop by people who say that this is the end of the world, says municipal councilor Mikael Lindfors (S). Municipal criticism of the change in the law Many smaller towns have been critical of the scrapping of track replacement. In C-controlled Laxå, they want to reintroduce the track change and in Lilla Edet, which is also controlled by the Center Party, they want those who are established to be able to be exempted from the rules. S-controlled Finspång believes that those who have not committed a crime should be given a residence permit immediately. Norsjö's Opposition Councilor Lars-Åke Holmgren (KD) is deeply moved by how the family has been affected by the current migration policy. - You have to look at this with tender reasons, it cannot be that everyone should be deported, he says. Deportations to Iran paused The Swedish Migration Agency has temporarily paused deportations to Iran due to the unrest in the country.

It was around 8pm one evening last week that it happened. William says he ran and got his phone to film the fox, which was still waiting outside the house.  - I squat down and then it starts nibbling on my hand, as if it thought I had food. \"Not natural\" It was the first time William caught the fox, but he was never afraid - even though it nibbled on his leg.  - I know it is not dangerous. In the moment I thought \"this must be unique, something that many people don't get to be a part of\". When the neighbors heard about the discovery, they were impressed. Some have seen it before and reported it, which William thinks is good. - It is not natural that it is in a residential area and is so close. I would think it is looking for food, which could be a problem. It must be able to fend for itself. The municipality does not intervene Henrik Engström at the forestry unit in the city of Borås has seen the film clips. He believes that it is not unusual for foxes to seek out close to people, but that measures are only relevant if they pose a danger. - It happens from time to time, but we only intervene when it is dangerous.

According to the American think tank ISW, Ukraine has achieved success on the battlefield and regained some ground in the southeastern parts.  Ukraine has launched counterattacks The think tank writes in its latest report that several villages have been liberated in the Dnipro region on the border with Donetsk in southeastern Ukraine. The Ukrainian military analyst Kostyantyn Mashovets, to whom ISW refers, writes on social media that Russia previously achieved certain successes in the area. \"However, about a week ago, the Russian advance was severely slowed and almost completely stopped. Ukrainian forces then launched a series of counterattacks,\" writes Mashovets. The counterattacks are said to have slowed down the Russian offensive and caused several Russian units to withdraw.  \"In several sectors, Ukraine managed to recapture villages and push back Russian vanguards up to 9-9.5 kilometers,\" writes Mashovets.  Despite the successes, Mashovets does not want to call it a counter-offensive, instead he believes that it is about tactical counter-attacks.  Biggest conquest since 2023 The news agency AFP has analyzed ISW's report and believes that Ukraine has reclaimed 201 square kilometers of land, it must have happened between Wednesday and Sunday last week. \"The retaken area is almost as large as the Russian gains throughout December and is the largest area that Kiev's forces have retaken in such a short period since the counter-offensive that began in June 2023,\" writes AFP. The military expert and former lieutenant colonel Jörgen Elfving describes the development as a success for Ukraine.  - It helps to increase the will to resist and that you have something to be happy about.

Last week, the FBI released video footage from Guthrie's residence showing a masked and armed man outside her front door on the night she was last seen. In connection with the release of the video, a glove was found a short distance from Guthrie's home, and on Sunday the FBI announced that it appeared to match the gloves worn by the suspect at the front door. The glove must now be quickly tested for DNA - a process that usually takes about a day. Daughter: \"Still Feeling Hope\" On the same day the FBI released the information about the glove, Savannah Guthrie posted a social media post pleading with the suspected kidnappers to release her mother Nancy Guthrie. \"It's been two weeks since our mother was taken from us, and I just want to say that we still feel hope,\" says a visibly shaken Savannah Guthrie, and continues: \"To whoever took her or knows where she is, I want to say that it's never too late, and you're not lost or alone. It's never too late to do the right thing, and we're here.\" Savannah Guthrie and her family have pleaded with the suspected kidnapper on several occasions to release Nancy Guthrie. Trump threatens consequences In a brief interview with the New York Post on Monday, US President Donald Trump stated that those who kidnapped Nancy Guthrie will face the \"very serious\" federal consequences if they do not return her in good condition. Trump also added that he would not be surprised if the Justice Department sought the death penalty. The FBI has previously offered upwards of 100,000 dollars, equivalent to just under a million Swedish kronor, for information that leads to Nancy Guthrie being found and the suspect(s) being arrested.

The technology, which is the only one of its kind, is based on the patient's own fat being collected through gentle liposuction. It is then mixed with a bio-ink and printed into implants in the desired shape. Karin Säljö, senior physician and docent in plastic surgery, sees great potential in the technology: - In the past, you only injected back the fatty tissue you took under the skin, which is a rather poor method. Now a way to control both the volume and the shape is possible, she says. Shorter surgery and better recovery According to the researchers at Sahlgrenska, a major advantage of the technology is that the implants consist of the body's own material. This increases the chance of a natural and sustainable result over time. The process is also expected to be significantly faster for larger reconstructions than with today's method, because both liposuction and bioprinting take place at the same time, explains Karin. - The current method can take five, six hours and also involves a long recovery time. The project has been going on for almost a decade, and only now are the researchers ready to take the next step – to begin trials on humans. The hope is that the first patients will be able to undergo surgery already during the year. The initial tests involve small implants being placed in the subcutaneous fat on the upper arm and then analyzed after a few months. Many patients forego reconstruction Not everyone who loses soft tissue chooses to have it reconstructed.  Within the Breast Cancer Association, there are today women who refrain from reconstructive surgery, even though many would really like to recreate their breast. That's what Susanne Dieroff Hay, president of the Breast Cancer Association, tells us. - Reconstruction is very important for many breast cancer patients, but many wish there were ways to recreate a breast that entail fewer complications, she says.

The man and the woman are from Kramfors in Västernorrland county, and the man has previously been convicted of violent crime.  How is the woman today? - I don't want to go into that. The concern: \"There could be more\" The man is suspected on probable grounds of gross pimping. The suspected sex trade must have been going on since December 2023, and the meetings must have taken place both physically and via the internet. The crimes are said to have taken place in Västernorrland County as well as in other parts of Sweden, and several suspected sex buyers have been identified. - Within the framework of the suspicion of pimping, it is primarily physical encounters that are investigated, says prosecutor Ida Annerstedt.  Several of the suspected sex buyers will probably be charged with aggravated pimping. - Other suspected sex buyers will not be covered by this prosecution, but they may be prosecuted later in parallel or separately in their own investigations, says Ida Annerstedt. Risking several years in prison Ida Annerstedt says that she has not been part of such an extensive investigation regarding pimping before, and the risk is that there are more perpetrators who have not yet been identified. - There could be more, absolutely. Investigation is still ongoing. The state of evidence against the man and some of the suspected sex buyers is assessed as good.  - There is, among other things, things that were found in the phones, and then there is also other written evidence and the oral material. There is another type of technical evidence, but a preliminary investigation is ongoing and preliminary investigation confidentiality prevails. The man denies any wrongdoing.

Despite that, pharmacies have started to see an increase in the sale of allergy medicine and that many are starting to notice symptoms. How is it possible with pollen in freezing temperatures? One explanation is that pollen gets here with southerly winds from parts of Europe where hazel has already started to bloom, says Agneta Ekebom, pollen expert at the museum. What causes the early pollen season? Climate change has generally led to warmer winters. This means that the pollen season is brought forward when the flowering occurs earlier and earlier. Longer and more intense Liselott Florén at the Asthma and Allergy Association says that the pollen season has also become longer and more intense. How many are allergic? According to the site Pollenkoll, a quarter of the population is allergic to pollen. Liselott Florén says that the number of allergic people in the Western world is increasing.  Florén mentions the two main reasons why it is increasing in the Nordics. When you are exposed to pollen for a longer period of time, the risk of becoming allergic increases. And as the climate down on the continent changes, other types of pollen move up towards northern Europe. Among other things, it concerns wormwood ambrosia, which is very allergenic. It grows in Central Europe and is now beginning to reach our latitudes, she adds. Equip the medicine cabinet What does the pollen season look like in the future? For those who are allergic to hazelnuts, it is good to pay attention to the forecasts and equip the medicine cabinet already now, says Liselott Florén. According to Pollenkoll, hazel is closely followed in time by alder. Next to each other come elm, aspen, birch and willow. Further into the spring comes oak and grass.

In a new Netflix documentary, we get to see the dark side of the program.  - It was much worse than what I remembered when I was younger, when I watched it, says Ellinor Bjurström about the documentary, who herself participated in \"Top Model Sweden\" ten years ago. Ellinor Bjurström was 18 years old when she was in the Swedish edition of the program. - I have a bit of a love-hate relationship with that time because Top Model Sweden changed my life so incredibly much in many different ways, she says. \"Had to stand there in pornographic clothes\" There are many events in the program that Ellinor Bjurström finds it hard to think back on. - I remember a photo shoot where we were a girl and a boy as a couple. Then one would be dominant and one submissive. Then we got there and were supposed to wear porn clothes. I was supposed to be submissive so I had to stand there in the porn clothes on all fours against a wall and he was holding a whip, she says. She says that she was far from alone in expressing that several situations were uncomfortable. - But what you forget is that we are there because it is our dream to become models and work with this. We listen to people we look up to and who know the industry. When they say that this is the way it is, you just have to do it or you have to leave, then you swallow your own opinions and feelings and get through it, she says. \"It's a shame that I didn't dare to speak up more\" When she thinks back to that time today, she wants to give her younger self a hug. - Right then and there, I think it's very sad that I didn't dare to speak up more, while at the same time I feel that I understand myself. I'm strangely proud that I got through it, she says. She says that much of the program was about provoking reactions. - I was, for example, one of those who had little county",

Bob passed away peacefully at home, surrounded by love and security.\"  Duvall was born in 1931 in San Diego and began acting in theater in New York during the 1950s. Among his classmates who studied under acting guru Sanford Meisner were Dustin Hoffman and Gene Hackman, among others. Collaboration with Coppola There was a long-term collaboration with the director Francis Ford Coppola. Robert Duvall starred in his \"Never Love a Stranger\" from 1969, in his first two \"Godfather\" films and also in \"Apocalypse now\" where Duvall's character is the one who utters the famous line \"I love the smell of napalm in the morning\". For the role of Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore, he was nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. He was awarded an Oscar in 1984 for his leading role in the western film \"På nåd och onåd\". After receiving the coveted statuette, he was considered to be affected by the \"Oscar curse\" and no longer received such interesting offers - while demanding a hefty fee for his efforts. This led, among other things, to him not being allowed to return to the role of Tom Hagen in \"The Godfather III\" in 1990. Coppola himself told this in the commentary track when the film was released on DVD. Oldest ever During the 1990s and 2000s, an increasingly aged Duvall made many memorable contributions in film and television. Among other things, he received a Golden Globe for his role as Josef Stalin in the TV movie \"Stalin\". In 2015, at the age of 84, he became the oldest actor ever to be nominated for an Oscar for best supporting actor in the film \"The judge\". However, the record was broken by Christopher Plummer a few years later. Robert Duvall was married four times, but never had any children. He was active almost to the end, starring in two films released in 2022. Robert Duvall turned 95.",

He believes that the attire risks undermining confidence in the legal process.  - You shouldn't dress shabby when judging people's lives and this seems to be a huge problem for both judges and prosecutors. I've had prosecutors come into the courtroom wearing thick sweaters with holes in them, says Stahre. - It sends signals that \"I don't care\" when you come in dressed like a homeless person. The solution: Suits As a solution, Stahre suggests that Sweden introduce uniforms, so-called coats, for legal actors - a system that already exists in Norway and Denmark, among others.  - It is something that is very wrong when news anchors on TV4 are more formally and stylishly dressed than judges and prosecutors who have to handle murders, he says in Nyhetsdagen. - As you probably know, people decide what they think of a person in just a few seconds, so I think it is important for trust in the judicial system that you dress completely and cleanly.",

A low pressure with snow and rain moves in over the southern parts of the country. In connection with this, the temperatures can go from many minus to a few plus degrees.  - What is happening this week is that the high pressure is starting to weaken and the weather is changing to a large extent, says Madeleine Westin.  Finland gets to take over the cold The long-term high pressure that has kept the cold air is now being pushed east towards Finland, which means that milder air can make its way over Sweden.  - Then moister air from the Atlantic can enter and provide milder weather, says Madeleine Westin.  This means a temporary interruption in the cold mode. In Götaland and possibly also parts of Svealand, temperatures can reach several plus degrees. Can produce large masses of water. There is no question of any more extensive or long-lasting heat. - However, the prognosis is still quite uncertain, says Madeleine Westin. When the weather gets warmer, the snow that has been in the country for a long time can have major effects.  - The cover can bring with it both slippery road conditions and large masses of water when the snow melts.",

One of those who was there to look at the aircraft was Infrastructure Minister Andreas Carlson (KD). He describes e-flight as a \"game changer\" for the transport sector and accessibility in Sweden. - I think it is important to see that electric flight is not science fiction that lies far into the future, but that we are on the brink of a breakthrough. Then you need to prepare both the infrastructure and the regulatory framework in order to draw out the opportunities that exist for the transformation of aviation. \"It's the draft you hear\" During the visit, the minister took the opportunity to take a flight down to Drottningholm in an American cargo plane. It can take upwards of half a ton of cargo, and the producer will also develop a smaller passenger plane for five passengers. - It was a great experience, and you are struck by how quiet it is. It's the draft you hear. Currently, there is no commercial air traffic with electric aircraft, and Andreas Carlson also does not know when it is realistic to count on there being regular traffic in Sweden. - The developers must be responsible for the technical development in detail, but my view is that politics needs to ensure that it does not fall behind, says Andreas Carlson. Not worried about the batteries The Nordic countries have taken the initiative to develop the regulatory framework to enable electric flight lines in and between the countries. It would not only be better for the climate - but also cheaper, says Andreas Carlson. - The route we flew cost about 40 bucks in charging. Despite the advantages, there are some question marks surrounding electric flights. Like electric cars, there is a concern that today's batteries are not sufficient for long transports within the country, and there is also concern about how the batteries will withstand the cold. However, Andreas Carlson is optimistic. - The development of battery capacity is fast, so it is important to both prepare and protect the infrastructure. The government sees great potential in this and that would be ok",

Previously, the levels were 10,000 and 5,000 kroner respectively.  - The grant is aimed at people who voluntarily want to return to the countries they originally come from, said Migration Minister Johan Forssell (M) when the proposal was presented in 2024. In the first month of the year alone, the Migration Agency has received 272 applications, compared to 152 in the whole of 2025. Then only one application was granted. Of this year's applications, 93 came from women and 179 from men. The majority, 170 people, are Syrian citizens.  None have been granted So far, 83 applications have been tried - all have been rejected, new figures from the Swedish Migration Agency show. 55 applicants lacked the right permit and 21 had debts with the Kronofogden or CSN. Others were rejected for other reasons.  According to the Swedish Migration Agency, processing normally takes longer than a month, which may contribute to the figures.  - Checking who has debts with the Kronofogden or CSN is fairly quick and then you get rejected immediately. But to get a positive decision you need to go through several steps, for example visiting the Migration Agency for a conversation, says press communicator Didzis Melbiksis. Forssell: No views Migration Minister Johan Forssell (M) announces that he has no views on how many choose to apply for the grant, as it is voluntary. - The new level came into effect about a month ago, so it is far too early to evaluate it or draw any conclusions, Forssell told TV4 Nyheterna.",

The man works as a principal at a school in Central Sweden, which TV4 Nyheterna was previously able to reveal. The prosecutor's office has confirmed that he is a school employee. After the arrest, the suspicions against the principal must have strengthened, the prosecutor states. On Monday, he was detained on probable cause, the higher level of suspicion, for several counts of child rape since the summer of 2025 and until February of this year. - It is a shorter period than I would have liked to have him detained for. I had primarily requested that he be detained for rape since the summer of 2024, says the prosecutor who leads the preliminary investigation. - There are several cases of rape, but I cannot comment on the number. \"Seized technical devices\" The victim must be a girl who was previously a student at the principal's school, according to information given to TV4 Nyheterna. The prosecutor does not want to comment on whether the sexual offenses should have taken place when the principal was on duty or not. - I will not comment on how the parties knew each other and did not or where the acts were supposed to have been committed. It is partly due to the fact that the preliminary investigation needs to be kept quiet, and partly that the plaintiff needs to be kept quiet, says the prosecutor. According to the prosecutor, the detainee denies any crime. - We will hold further interrogations and we have seized technical devices that will be reviewed and analyzed. There have also been investigations where we are waiting for test results. The relevant municipality has asked to come back with a comment after the detention hearing.",

The family was sent to Gävle hospital and after several examinations it was clear that she had a serious congenital heart defect.  - It was terrible. It felt like someone pulled something from under our feet, says Ingela Eriksson, Lova's mother.  For large parts of her life, Lova has been cared for in hospital, and got to meet many hospital clowns, she says in Nyhetsmorgon. In total, she has been operated on four times, with the first operation taking almost twelve hours. Today she has both a pacemaker and a mechanical valve.  - Now I have a pacemaker up here, says Lova and points to her chest.  In 2024, seven children died Despite her congenital heart defect, Lova lives an active life and moves like any seven-year-old – she climbs, plays and is constantly in motion.  - We usually say that she is more wild than tame and joke that it is her pacemaker that is an extra battery and drives her to keep going, says Ingela Eriksson.  Every year around 2,000 children are born in Sweden with congenital heart defects. According to Kristina Sparreljung, secretary general of the Heart-Lung Foundation, survival has improved greatly in recent decades. In 2000, 39 children with congenital heart defects died. In 2024, the number was seven. - This development has been driven by the technological development that made it possible to find children with severe congenital heart defects already during pregnancy. This means that these children can be received in prepared operating units, says Kristina Sparreljung. \"Live now, die later\" She states that research has progressed, among other things through the possibility today to see children's hearts in three-dimensional images - something that was not possible just a few years ago. At the same time, there are continuing challenges. \n\n- Children with congenital heart defects suffer to a greater extent than other adults from other cardiovascular complications earlier in life, says Kristina Sparreljung.

A long series of special rules adapted to children will be introduced, among other things, provisions will be introduced on \"the best interests of the child\".  Detained children must also have the right to be heard and the child's views must be taken into account. This does not mean that the incarcerated children themselves can decide on the enforcement, but their best interests and the opinions they express must be taken into account.  \"It's important that we invest in education\" Another thing is that young people and adults should be kept apart. It is an important measure to prevent young people from being schooled into more serious crime.  Just like adults, young people will be covered by the Prison Act's employment obligation, but it will mainly consist of education.  - It is important that we invest in education. It's about which children we want to get out after serving their sentence, says Martin Melin, justice policy spokesperson for the Liberals.  Each inmate must have an individual plan with a focus on education and relapse prevention treatment. The plan must be drawn up by the Correctional Service in close cooperation with social services and the guardian. More right to contact with family In many parts, the regulations that apply to adult inmates will also apply to incarcerated children. However, a number of other adaptations to the legislation are proposed, to ensure that enforcement is adapted to children's special needs and rights. A rule is introduced in the Prison Act that children's right to maintain contact with their family must be taken into account in particular in matters of visits and other contacts. The purpose is, among other things, to reduce the risk of adverse effects of the deprivation of liberty. In 2025, there were 259 people aged 15-18 who were sentenced to closed youth care at the State Board of Institutions SIS. If current laws had been in force, they would have been sentenced to youth prison instead, according to the government office's assessments. In the future, there will be more people because",

Råd and Rön have tested 21 types of complete food for adult dogs and the amount of protein, carbohydrates, minerals and fatty acids has been checked, among other things. Worst in test Three products end up at the bottom because of too low a nutritional content. Magnusson adult and Doggy original both had too little methionine. The latter brand and Coop Xtra dog food contain too little vitamin A. - Coop Xtra and Doggy have cereal as the first ingredient. Those that have it as the first ingredient end up at the bottom of our table, that they have a slightly lower nutritional content, says Anna Edberg, responsible for food tests at Råd & Rön.  However, at the bottom of the list is Petgood dog adult insect based, which is one of two products containing insects. Both fare well nutritionally, but Petgood stands out negatively. Namely, the feed contains high levels of glycoalkaloids, which can form in poorly handled potatoes and which can be toxic to the dog.  - This one contains high levels of these poisons, says Anna Edberg in the news morning.  Petgood writes to TV4 Nyhetsmorgon that measures have been taken to ensure low levels of glycoalkaloids and that no dogs have been found to be ill so far.   Big differences in price The price differences are big and the kilo price for the tested products varies between SEK 18 and 225. The price difference partly depends on which ingredients the feed contains, where meat and animal products are often more expensive. While different cereals are cheaper.

  "e92e36ee4b095225361434fd16595a83c95b953c": "The study is based on a survey of 2,000 families in Gaza, selected to represent the population. The researchers tallied both direct and indirect deaths between the terrorist attack on Israel on October 7, 2023 and January 5, 2025. In total, 42,200 women, children and the elderly died in attacks – 56 percent of the direct deaths. The study also shows that the Ministry of Health's reporting on the proportion of women, children and the elderly among the dead has been correct. Fewer indirect deaths The researchers estimate that 3-4 percent of Gaza's population has been killed in the conflict. A further 8,000 people are believed to have died indirectly from, for example, diseases or malnutrition, according to the study.  Researcher Michael Spagat has been working on calculating deaths in conflicts for twenty years.  He questions an earlier study, also published in the Lancet, which showed that the indirect deaths were far more than the direct ones – probably around four times as many.  - In Gaza, there were initially resources in the form of trained doctors and a functioning health system. In addition, the area is small, so once help arrives it can be quickly distributed, says Spagat. May never get answers Data on death tolls have been disputed. An Israeli security source recently said the Gaza health ministry's figures are \"largely correct\". The Department of Health now states that over 71,660 people have been killed directly by Israeli attacks, including more than 570 after the October 2025 ceasefire. Other studies have reached similar conclusions, but some have estimated even more indirect deaths and a greatly reduced life expectancy. The researchers behind the Lancet study believe that it will take a long time before there is a complete picture of the death toll.\n\n- It is not a given that there will be a large research project to reconstruct what actually happened. It will take a long time before we get a full account of all the dead in Gaza, if we ever get it, says Michael Spagat.",

Among other things, several military ships and warplanes have been sent to the area and an aircraft carrier is already near Iran. An attack was supposed to take place this weekend, but Donald Trump has not yet decided on an attack, according to CNN. - There are many arguments to put forward for an attack, says White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. At the same time, she emphasizes that diplomacy is still the president's first option. - I will not set any deadlines for the president. Diplomacy is always his first option, but military action remains on the table. Agree on guiding principles On Wednesday, senior security advisers gathered in the White House to discuss the situation, according to a source with access to information. Even then, Trump is said to have been updated with what was said in the indirect talks that were recently held with Iran in Geneva. The indirect talks between the US and Iran continued for several hours. According to Iran's chief negotiator, the parties agreed on some guiding principles, but US officials say many details remain before any settlement can be reached. At the same time, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt states that Iran is expected to present a more detailed proposal within the coming weeks. At the same time, it is unclear whether the US is patient enough to wait for the proposal before a possible military decision is made. Israel may participate According to Israeli sources to Axios, Israel may also participate in a possible attack on Iran. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is expected to travel to Israel on February 28 to inform Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the negotiations and the current situation. Several Arab states have reportedly tried to dissuade the United States from a military intervention out of fear that the entire region will be further destabilized. At the same time, new satellite images show that Iran is strengthening protection around several important nuclear facilities, according to the US",

They use the event for propaganda purposes, to mobilize support and to recruit new members, says Christer Mattsson, researcher at the University of Gothenburg. - It is a matter of course for these groups to stand up for people who belong to their own environment and who in this case have lost their lives, says Christer Mattsson. - National borders are not really that interesting to them, but what is important is whiteness. That white people stick together racially and culturally, he continues. Want to avenge the murder On social media there are also discussions about revenge for the 23-year-old's death and calls to find the culprits.  - Violence is seen as a means of seizing power, but it also has the ideological component that it separates the strong from the weak. Through violence also comes sacrifice. In Sweden, among others, White Boys Sweden and Aktivklubb Sweden have honored Deranque on social media. White Boys Stockholm has also held a demonstration for the victim. \"White man, fight back\", and \"Justice for Quentin\" are some of the posts. \"Quentin is with us,\" the group writes in a post. Want to avenge the murder Martyrdom Mattsson explains that martyrdom is deeply rooted in the far-right movement. –",

The association believes that it is important for children's motor skills and coordination, while at the same time it prevents bullying.  - You can sprain a foot, but a foot heals. Missed training in courage, reciprocity and trust can probably leave bigger scars, says Jennie Nobelius, president of the Swedish Sports Teachers' Association.  Support from research In Sweden, it is the municipalities and schools that decide what is permitted and the Swedish National Agency for Education has no general recommendation. Snowball fights are prohibited at Skanskvarnsskolan in Stockholm.  - The children can play in other ways. There is a difference between a home environment and a school environment, we have responsibility for the children's safety and security, says the school's principal Ingrid Gustavsson. Rune Storli, docent at Queen Maud's University in Trondheim, has researched risky play and believes that it is an important part of children's exploration.  - It is a good arena for developing social skills and learning about boundaries. It's like the Astrid Lindgren quote: \"he who is very strong must also be very kind\". He refers to studies that show that children who are allowed to play risky develop social skills more easily.  - When children do not meet physically in wild play, they lose an important dimension of how to learn to be social. Even animals play in this way. \"Arguments happen all the time\" The Swedish Sports Teachers' Association believes that excessive protection can inhibit children's development.  - We are creating a bubble wrap society where safety replaces development in the children, says Jennie Nobelius.  Ingrid Gustavsson does not share the image that children are protected too much and questions how snowball fights should counter bullying.  - I find it difficult to see how wrestling or snowball fights could achieve what we want to achieve within the school. Jennie Nobelius sees conflicts as part of learning, if it takes place under the supervision of adults.  - Ordinary quarrels happen all the time and conflict management is a must",

It was only when a colleague saw the flames and shouted her name that the situation became serious.  \"I didn't notice it was on fire\" The colleague's shout made her react.\n \n- I thought: Where the hell is that coming from? And then I looked in the mirror – yes! Then it was just a matter of turning it off quickly, she says. Even though it burned badly, Marie did not suffer any damage to her skin. However, she had to say goodbye to part of her hair, and to the big tassel she used to have. - It might say something about how much hair I actually have, although you can't see it now. It has become less. I lost some, says Söderberg. Caught on film The incident was caught on the store's surveillance camera and the clip has spread quickly on social media. When Marie and her colleagues saw the film afterwards, they were shocked by how powerful the flames were, but today they can laugh about it. The fact that it was also Friday the 13th is not something she missed.\n\n - If you are shocked, you can think about whether it had anything to do with the case or not, she says with a laugh. Today, she is most grateful that it all, thank God, ended well. Now Marie would like to remind others to be careful with candles.",

In recent days, the attackers have come across booking information, email addresses and phone numbers. The chain was alerted to the incident via customer service and the hotel, which raised the alarm. Marketing manager Sara Hallsund cannot answer the exact date of when the attack took place. - We are of course investigating what has happened and what kind of messages are going out. Unfortunately, it is really a big social problem today and now we have also been affected by this, she says.

Then it says that \"action is required\" and that the booking is not \"fully completed\". The customer is then prompted to click on a link.\n\nVia the link, the attackers want the customer to confirm their payment card number. The payment card information has not been leaked, according to Sara Hallsund. - So that's what you're trying to fish for, she says.  Exactly what type of attack it is is not yet clear. - We have brought in a data security partner who helps us see what is happening, says Hallsund. \"Be vigilant\" On Best Western's Swedish website, there is a message at the top of the site.

The party's foreign policy spokesperson Aron Emilsson believes that the situation Sweden is in is \"beginning to resemble\" a gray area, something TT reported. Unlike Norway, Sweden has no legal ban on nuclear weapons - and the position is that nuclear weapons should not be in Sweden in peacetime.  Requires broad discussion Sweden's nuclear deterrent lies primarily with the United States - of which Sweden is a part through NATO membership, emphasizes Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard.  - Then there are important complements in Europe, partly in Great Britain and partly in France. There is a doctrine in Sweden and we have also written in the NATO bill that in peacetime you do not have nuclear weapons on Swedish soil. Malmer Stenergard refers to Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson's statement that Sweden is not at war but not at peace either. At the same time, the nuclear weapons discussion should not be a matter of interpretations, she believes. - If this is to be changed, then there must be a serious discussion within the alliance, between allies in NATO and of course there must also be broad support in the Riksdag. It's not something you change lightly, says Malmer Stenergard and adds that a discussion should also be held with the Nordic countries. Serious situation She does not rule out that the issue may need to be reviewed, but emphasizes that it requires both national and Nordic anchoring.  - Actually, I don't think you should rule anything out when we have such a serious security policy situation in Europe and a war in our immediate area. There is a lot that we didn't think would happen that has happened in a fairly short time, says Malmer Stenergard.",

The American president is fickle, but lately his statements have mostly been about Ukraine needing to be more willing to negotiate and compromise.  While there have been exceptions over the past year, Trump has rarely talked about Russian concessions.  The common thread has nevertheless been that it is President Zelensky who should understand his and his country's best interests and end the war even if it means enormous concessions.\n\nAs two days of talks ended in Geneva today, it was clear that both the Russian and Ukrainian delegations were of the same opinion: that the deliberations had been difficult.  Both sides said the parties will meet again, but no dates were announced. The outside world had not expected a breakthrough, but perhaps some details have become clearer to those involved beyond the media noise surrounding the meetings. The war is far away for the Americans In a week, Ukraine commemorates the fallen on the anniversary of four years of war. No other war in Europe since the Second World War has shaken the continent like Russia's large-scale invasion in 2022. The fate of Ukraine is constantly on the agenda when Europe's politicians meet and has had far-reaching consequences for security policy, defense budgets and people's view of the future on our continent.  At the same time, war is now everyday life for Ukrainians, Europeans and perhaps Americans. Why do I write \"maybe\"? Well, because the war has always been far away for the Americans. \"Has his legacy to think about\" Therefore, it is not just Trump's pursuit of the peace prize or a general impatience that explains why he wants to quickly end the war - possibly as early as the summer, as it is claimed.  Many Americans do not understand how Ukraine concerns them, and Trump has both his aftermath and the November midterm elections on his mind.  From this perspective, one can see T",

At the same time, the radio station NRJ loses its licence. - This is a shock message that we find difficult to take in. We are both sad and upset. 1.5 million listeners will lose their radio station and our employees risk losing their jobs, says NRJ CEO Richard Mazeret in a press release. NRJ has been broadcast for 33 years in Sweden - and is the only commercial radio station that increased its listenership figures in 2025. - We are the only actor that is growing. At the same time, the license is instead given to a completely unproven actor with no experience in radio, and who also increases the media concentration in Sweden. This makes the Media Authority's decision very difficult to understand, says Richard Mazeret.  The explanation: \"There are only three permits\" At the same time, Aftonbladet calls this a historic step. - This is one of our biggest investments in many years, and a clear expression of our ambition to reach more people with journalism in everyday life, says Lotta Folcker, publisher at Aftonbladet to Aftonbladet.  NRJ is forced to stop broadcasting on July 31 this year - and the license passes to Aftonbladet the following day. The media authority believes that they are handing over the license so that Aftonbladet can offer something new to the listeners, as they will have a news focus. - There are only three permits, and if Aftonbladet is to broadcast radio, someone else has to leave. Then we came to the conclusion that it is NRJ that must give way because the frequencies must be used efficiently, says Ola Vigström, a lawyer at the Media Authority to Aftonbladet.  The profile: \"We carry on as usual\" Sofia Wistam, Anis don Demina and Sebastian \"Basse\" Widman are all big profiles at NRJ. \"It feels boring, of course, but now it's up to us to get as many regional permits as possible so we can continue to be heard in large parts of the country,\" writes Sebastian \"Basse\" Widman in a text message to TV4 Nyheterna.

That we have looked at what others are doing. That we don't have to experience everything ourselves to dare to do things. So this particular thing about what others are doing has been very good for us. It seems good to eat watermelon, then I also eat watermelon, says Per Carlbring. Another reason is to see things from a new perspective. - That you can go out and perhaps see your home from a different angle. But think before you go out. It's lovely, but is it worth it? \"Getting a shock\" You should think about what happens if you fall and what the consequences are. - Would you go for a winter swim on your own?

Within the building and construction industry, it was exclusively serious bribery that took place last year, says Parul Sharma. - I think it's time for this industry to actually get to grips with the matter. We have not seen as many serious bribery crimes gathered in one industry as we have in 2025. It is serious and alarming, she says in Nyhetsmorgon. Nepotism common The average bribery offender is a 51-year-old man working in the private sector. The recipient is also within the same age group, but works in the public sector. - This is often where we see our bribery crimes in Sweden take place. If you look at last year's bribery convictions, we see that in 65 percent of the cases, it is about the exercise of authority, says Parul Sharma. Half of all bribery convictions in 2025 were related to crony corruption or nepotism. - We see a fairly high degree of nepotistic relationships in the serious bribery offences. It is old colleagues, sometimes family members, with whom you do business, says Parul Sharma. \"Cash is still king\" Bribes usually consist of money, vehicles, pleasure trips and restaurant visits. Renovations are also common – it is used as an indirect payment, explains Parul Sharma. - When we at the institute ask what Swedes think is the most common bribe, people usually say: \"Not money, well, that's far too shameful.\" But cash is still king.

The scenario is based on real events from Ukraine and aims to train on complex and extreme situations that cannot be reproduced on a regular training ground. The virtual environment makes it possible to move freely and interact with both people and the environment. Researchers from the University of Skövde are behind the project. So far, roughly 120 rescue officers around the country have been able to try out the concept, which is based on computer game technology where the situation can be updated in real time depending on which decisions are made. Authentic drone images from Ukraine To increase the realism, authentic drone images from a school in Ukraine are used, where the emergency services inspected the building from the inside using drones. Cecilia Hammar Wijkmark, researcher at the University of Skövde, explains that the project focuses on creating a realistic feeling in the exercise. - We look a lot at what contributes to the feeling of presence, what gives a realistic feeling in this event. It can be everything from the visual elements, sound and interaction with the technology, she says. Provides important experiences Pär Hagbohm believes that although the physical feeling of touching things may be missing, the exercise provides important experiences for the management function. - I think there may be a certain lack of being able to physically touch things. But here we actually isolate the management function of training and decision-making. Here, we get to see so many aspects of this particular thing with the management perspective and leading and making decisions, he says.",

But in 2023, unknown people began registering at Ulla-Lena's cottage - hundreds of people who have no connection to the house.  - I usually describe it as being part of an ongoing burglary, because that's how it feels. I almost always have to be prepared for people to show up, says Ulla-Lena Lindqvist. \"The Tax Agency puts me in danger\" Ulla-Lena has turned to both the police and the Tax Agency, but she got no help there. In the end, she sued the state for violation of the European Convention together with the Center for Justice. In connection with that, Elisabeth Svantesson (M) was called to the tax committee, and said that she would discuss a solution with the Tax Agency. Now two months have passed and nothing has happened – 66 people are still written to Ulla-Lena's address.  - I believe that the Swedish Tax Agency exposes me to danger, she says. Today, an interpellation debate took place in the Riksdag regarding Ulla-Lena Lindqvist's case, and she was able to meet Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson (M). - It sounded like she was thinking of taking action and contacting the Tax Agency quite immediately. And we gave her suggestions that you can remove my addresses already today or tomorrow without changes to the law, says Ulla-Lena. The Minister of Finance ducked interview Ulla-Lena Lindqvist is not alone in being affected by incorrect bookkeeping. The Swedish Tax Agency annually receives around 20,000 complaints from people who have discovered that someone else is registered at their address. - For Ulla-Lena, it is a clear problem that many people subscribe to her address and use her summer cottage as a mailbox for criminals.

This prompted Trump to react, saying that Obama's statement is against laws and regulations. Obama, according to NBC News, later clarified his statement, saying that \"the odds are good that there is life out there.\" Thousands of reports at the Pentagon Trump refer to the fact that there is a huge public interest in getting access to these documents, as a justification for the decision to make the documents public. The question is what the UFO files will include and Clas Svahn, chairman of UFO-Sweden says that there is a lot of interesting material in the documents. \n\n- Aro, the Pentagon's UFO office, has said that there are reports they have received in recent years that defy their explanations. Aro has over 2,000 reports that have come in over the past few years, many from US pilots and defense facilities. There can be exciting things there, he says. \n\nSvahn goes on to say that among the most talked about events is the so-called Tic-Tac incident off the coast of California in 2004, where pilots observed an object that moved in a way that could not be explained.\n\n- Two pilots see an object that moves like soap in a soap dish which is incredibly strange, I want to see radar material there. \"A lot is blacked out like in the Epstein files\" Svahn believes that much of the material will be heavily redacted once it is made public. - I think it will be difficult and much will certainly be obscured. It will be like in the Epstein documents, not much will come out. Secret seal protects military technology According to NBC News, Trump has instructed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, other officials and relevant agencies to begin the process.

He believes that both Sweden and Tottenham have all the conditions to succeed, but that the results are still lacking.  - It is one of England's most historic clubs - a rich association with a huge arena, loyal and extensive supporter base, everything that is required to be a top team. Nevertheless, Tottenham are currently in crisis. \"Wrong decision\" Earlier this week, the Fiscal Policy Council criticized the government's economic policy, including for having borrowed for defense at the same time as lowering income tax. Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson (M) replied that the Riksdag had agreed that defense investments should not \"crowd out\" other investments. - I will never apologize for strengthening Swedish households in a time that is very tough, replies Svantesson to that criticism.

What the visitors don't know is that two policemen are hiding under the traditional garb, with their eyes fixed on a suspicious man in the crowd.  The person in question is a 33-year-old man who is suspected of breaking into a local police chief on three occasions in the past month. According to the police, valuables to the value of approximately two million baht - equivalent to more than SEK 500,000 - have been stolen.  The video shows how the lion dancers slowly approach the man before suddenly pouncing, wrestling him down and carrying out the arrest in the middle of the market visitors.

By tracking stolen amulets he sold, investigators were able to identify him and chart his movement patterns.

Today the ceiling is 80 percent of the home's value, but in April it will be raised to 90 percent. \n\n- The reason is that they want to make it easier for first-time buyers to enter the housing market. In big cities, hundreds of thousands of kroner can be required in investment, so it is not so easy to enter the housing market, says economics journalist Frida Bratt.  The downside is that people are expected to become more indebted. The house price is affected by the new rules. There will also be new rules about how much you need to amortize. \n- This applies to those who are highly leveraged, i.e. those who have a loan-to-value ratio that is over 70 percent of the home's value and have a loan that is four and a half times higher than their income. So far you have had to amortize three percent, but that is now reduced to two percent, says Frida Bratt.  More expensive apartments The new conditions are expected to have consequences for housing prices, especially for smaller apartments in big cities.\n- These are attractive homes for young first-time buyers and these homes could rise in price because more people now have the opportunity to participate in a bidding process, says Frida Bratt.",

Justice Minister Gunnar Strömmer (M) has said that the Moderates want to investigate the question of whether chemical castration should be required for the parole of convicted pedophiles after the election. SD and KD have previously put forward the same proposal. A: \"Reasonable\" Now the Social Democrats are also behind the idea and thus there is a majority for the proposal.

In addition to castration, S wants to toughen the punishment for child pornography crimes. The party is also coming forward with two more proposals to prevent pedophile crimes. - The police must be alerted to sensitive activities where there are children if you suspect that there are pedophiles working there, for example at independent schools but also at playgrounds and babysitting and other things, says Teresa Carvalho and continues: - We need to lower the threshold quite obviously for when police and prosecutors are allowed to access computers with secret data reading to secure evidence.",

During the week, memorial services were held across the country for the thousands of protesters who were killed. In several places the commemorations have turned into new protests against the regime where slogans against the regime have been chanted. According to the American think tank CTP-ISW, twelve demonstrations in seven Iranian provinces took place on Tuesday. In the city of Abdanan in northwestern Iran, security forces are reported to have fired at mourners at the burial grounds. But the commemorative ceremonies have this time taken on a new character. Instead of religious rituals, including Koran reading, music, song and dance have taken their place.  In videos of funerals now circulating, mothers and fathers urge others to sing and live, clap and dance.  Grief as political resistance Writer and Iranian exile Atefeh Sebdani calls it \"resistance in its strongest form\". She explains that it's about relatives refusing to let the state own their grief - and turning it into political resistance.  This in a country where the Islamic Republic has long built its legitimacy on martyrdom and ritualized grief, the symbolic rebellion against grief as a means of power has now become clear, she explains.  - At these funerals and memorial ceremonies that we now see, you can seem to see something as bizarre as a party. But just scratching the surface a little, you understand that this is the strongest act of resistance you can see, says Atefeh Sebdani. Risking their lives But it is also about the wishes of the victims themselves - often young people who risk their lives for democracy. - We have seen testimonies, terribly heartbreaking wills that have come out.

Promise you'll celebrate. - This is an act that I have been so close to wanting to dig into the history books to see about men",

I will not go into closer details than that, says Henrik Olin at the national unit for security goals to TV4 Nyheterna.  It is unclear in what way the man is suspected of having been active in the organization.  - A participation offense requires some form of activity. It is not enough to have sympathies or to stand behind an organization, it is about something more than that, says Henrik Olin.  The man has previously been suspected of damage linked to Sweden's security. He was taken in for questioning in the intervening days but was later released. He was detained for five days. According to the prosecutor, the suspected crime of participation in a terrorist organization lasted from November 6, 2025 until he was arrested. - It is a young person, previously unpunished. There is a mental ill-being in the picture that the court decides that a doctor should analyze and look at, says Henrik Olin.  Shortly after he was interrogated by Säpo, he was forcibly cared for in a psychiatric ward, documents that TV4 Nyheterna have seen show. The man appealed the decision to the administrative court, which rejected the appeal.  According to the chief medical officer, the man was judged to suffer from a serious mental disorder and to have an \"indispensable need for round-the-clock psychiatric care for observation, investigation and continuous monitoring\", the documents state.  He was remanded in custody for five days. \"During the period of treatment, information emerged that what was previously interpreted as delusions is actually reality,\" writes the chief medical officer in his statement. On Säpo's radar In connection with the arrest, the Attunda district court also decided that a so-called small forensic psychiatric examination should be carried out.

Dramatic images of politicians barricading themselves in the parliament building, soldiers trying to storm it and civilians trying to stop armored vehicles were shared around the world.  Six hours The decision was made without political support and within six hours the National Assembly managed to gather and vote to overturn it. The state of emergency lasted for six hours.  The incident sparked mass protests and was described as an attempt to condone Yoon's power.  Ten days later, parliament voted to impeach him. He was immediately suspended and later formally deposed as well. Long investigation The investigation against the former president continued throughout 2025. Yoon has defended his decisions as necessary to protect democracy. Prosecutors have argued throughout that the president abused his power to neutralize political opponents and circumvent the democratic process.  Yesterday he was sentenced by the court in Seoul to life imprisonment for attempted sedition.

After weeks of freezing temperatures, the bodies of water are covered by a solid layer of ice, but appearances can be deceiving. Although the ice looks stable, these types of lakes where the water is regulated can be treacherous. - When the water level changes, the ice becomes weaker. It breaks up. Cracks can appear in the ice and therefore the ice can become dangerous, says Anton El Raai, operating engineer for circulation and water within the City of Gothenburg. Like a hammock In Gothenburg, the municipality has specifically warned against entering the Delsjöarna, but this type of regulated lakes can be found all over the country. It is not enough that the ice itself becomes unstable. If water is drained after the ice has formed, a gap of several decimetres can be created between the ice cover and the water surface. - Then it becomes even more dangerous, because then the ice becomes like a hammock above the water and then you can fall if you feel bad, says Kim Loob Almbratt, biologist at Sportfiskarna. This \"hammock effect\" on the one hand increases the pressure on the ice when the water does not relieve it, and on the other hand the person who falls through risks getting stuck under the ice without the possibility of climbing up. The expert advises against When TV4 meets Kim Loob Almbratt, he and Sportfiskarna are out with a school class showing things you can do on the ice, such as ice fishing. But they are not out on the Delsjöarna, but have chosen another lake in Gothenburg where the ice is stable. - I wouldn't have ventured out on an ice that has a lot of regulation, nor a water source if I'm not absolutely sure that I will be able to handle this.

He rejects Russian demands for territorial concessions and warns that Vladimir Putin must face heavy military and economic pressure.  Ahead of the anniversary on Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyi describes Russia's full-scale invasion as the start of a third world war, the BBC reports. - I think Putin has already started it. The question is how much territory he will be able to conquer and how to stop him. Russia wants to impose a different way of life on the world, says Zelenskyy to the BBC. TV4's foreign reporter, Johan Fredriksson, who is in Kiev, believes that Zelenskyj is right in many ways.  - He is right in many ways. What we have been talking about is the dictatorship alliance, it is China, Belarus, North Korea and Iran that more or less actively support Russia in the invasion of Ukraine, says Johan Fredriksson.\n\n- So it is an international conflict with many countries involved, he continues. He emphasizes that Zelensky right now needs international support and attention, and that he therefore highlights this in the interview with the BBC. Rejects demands The interview with Zelenskyi was conducted at the government headquarters in Kyiv over the weekend. Russia is demanding that Ukraine hand over the 20 percent of the Donetsk region it still controls, as well as additional areas in Kherson and Zaporizhzhya and several other cities.  Zelenskyy rejects these demands and believes that it is about more than just land. - I see this differently. I don't just see it as land. I see it as us abandoning—weakening our positions, abandoning hundreds of thousands of our people who live there. I am sure that this \"retreat\" would split our society, Zelenskyy told the newspaper. Warns of truce Zelensky warns that a truce would give Putin time to recover and continue the war within a couple of years.

A man presented as Nyhetsmorgon's employee Mikael \"Soldoktorn\" Sandström recommends capsules that are claimed to be able to make Peter \"completely healthy in a few weeks\". - It seemed authentic. So this gave me hope of finding a very flexible solution to my osteoarthritis, says Peter Smedman. When Peter enters the webshop, he sees something that makes him take the step to go ahead and order the capsules.  - Klarna came up as a payment option. As I have used Klarna before, I thought it was very good. It gave some credibility, he says. That, says former prosecutor Stefan Lundberg, is a central part of the scheme. - It's part of the criminal plan, this for the customer to see the Klarna logo and feel safe, just like Peter did here, and not get any idea that this is fraud. \"Prison is a normal punishment\" Behind the webshops is a Dutch company that is clearly aimed at Sweden - with Swedish-language marketing and Swedish internet addresses. The miracle pills are sold under several names – including Calm X and Leaf Lab.  Kallafakta's review shows that for nine months Klarna acted as a payment intermediary in the fraud. Klarna's actions may be criminal according to several experts who took part in Kalla fakta's research. - It could be money laundering. It can be aiding and abetting fraud, which can also be serious fraud. This means that prison is a normal punishment, says Stefan Lundberg, former chief prosecutor at the Ecocrime Authority. \"Strictly prohibited\" In the marketing, the capsules are claimed to be able to cure cancer, epilepsy, heart disease and other serious diseases.

The house where he was born, which has recently been a sheltered workshop for the disabled, was bought by the state in 2016 and is now being renovated to become a police station. Ludwig Laher is a writer and member of the Mauthausen Committee Austria, an organization that draws attention to the Mauthausen concentration camp. He is critical of the plan. - A police station is problematic. The police - and this is not a criticism of them - must protect the interests of the state in any political system. They must therefore simply obey the state. Resistance within the police force is a rare phenomenon, he told AFP. \"Understand that you want to avoid people using it as a place of remembrance\" Ludwig Laher says that other possibilities have been discussed. - An idea that received a lot of support was a \"responsibility house\", a place where young people from different parts of the world could develop strategies for peace work, international understanding and peaceful relations between people. German Sibylle Treiblmaier, 53, thinks the situation is like a \"double-edged sword\". - I think the house could have been used better or differently, and I understand that you want to avoid people using it as a memorial to Hitler.

The unrest is spreading The unrest is said to have also spread to the neighboring state of Michoacan. And social media videos from the resort of Puerto Vallarta appear to show dark plumes of smoke rising from parts of the city. The unrest has led to Air Canada canceling its flights to the resort.

One of Mexico's Most Wanted Before his death, Oseguera was one of Mexico's most wanted and a $15 million reward for information leading to his capture was announced by the United States.  Mexico also had a juicy reward announced for information about El Mencho. 300 million Mexican pesos, equivalent to approximately 158 million Swedish kronor, would go to whoever could see to it that he was caught.

I have decent finances and can even consider taking his legal costs. I am unreserved on the perpetrator's side, said GW Persson at the time. The criticism was not long in coming. Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard (M) wrote in an X post that he \"increasingly showed evidence of a lack of judgment\" and \"crossed a sharp line\". \"Now is the time to let GW retire?\", wrote SD leader Jimmie Åkesson and believes that GW Persson \"trivializes, even encourages threats against politicians\". GW: \"People can think what they want\" Now GW Persson comments on the criticism.  - People can think what they want. Regarding my pension, it is something I will wait for as long as I can, he says. The criminologist believes that the apples outside Johan Forssell's door were not about any threat, but were a legitimate protest against an \"unreasonable, racist policy\". - It's about children and teenagers being deported to countries they've never been to. When people protest against it, I think it's a sign of health.

These goblins don't usually do that. - I have been threatened a lot. If I had received some apples with a mustache at home, I would never have thought of reporting it as a threat. GW also points out that he was one of the few who took Åkesson's side when someone \"pushed a certain pastry in his face\". He then refers to the incident in 2013 when a woman threw a cake in the SD leader's face and was convicted of molestation. - You can't do that, and that judgment was completely correct, says Leif GW Persson.",

  "9b45dc591bad7600aea70c6ac7dfacf5964d5c75": "The situation is a direct consequence of the energy crisis that has worsened since oil deliveries to Cuba were stopped. The country is heavily dependent on imported oil, above all from Venezuela, which has long served as an economic lifeline. Following the US intervention in Venezuela and the subsequent blockade of Venezuelan oil, supply has been severely curtailed. The US has also threatened to impose punitive tariffs on countries that continue to sell oil to Cuba – which has contributed to further isolating the country. In an attempt to manage the crisis, Cuba's foreign minister traveled to Moscow yesterday for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. - Our countries have a special relationship that has developed historically. We have always stood by Cuba in its struggle for independence and the right to choose its own path, Putin said after the meeting. Russia has condemned the actions of the United States and promised continued support to Cuba. Mexico has also sent humanitarian aid in the form of food and hygiene items. President Claudia Sheinbaum has said the country wants to continue helping Cuba and is exploring the possibility of supplying oil without suffering US sanctions. UN warns of humanitarian crisis UN chief António Guterres has warned that the lack of oil risks leading to a serious humanitarian situation. The fuel shortage is already affecting the food supply, transport and healthcare. At the same time, the US has made it clear that the goal is a political change on the island. President Donald Trump has said the Cuban government faces a choice and needs to make drastic changes. The Cuban government has introduced several emergency measures to save fuel, including rationing and reduced public transport. But despite the measures, everyday life is becoming increasingly difficult for many Cubans. Power outages are becoming more and more frequent, transport is being canceled and access to food is deteriorating. In the streets of Havana, the mountains of garbage continue to grow – a visible symbol of a crisis that now pervades the entire society.",

It can be compared to the 2024-2025 season, when 70 people lost their lives on the slopes. - You can see that there are very avalanche-dangerous conditions in parts of the Alps right now, and have been recently. Overall, it's a very difficult winter, says Petter Palmgren, avalanche expert at the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency. The fact that there are so many avalanches is due to the fact that it has been both snow-poor and cold. - The snow is very weak. Once new snow arrives, conditions will be optimized for people to trigger avalanches, says Palmgren. Difficult to assess the danger In almost all avalanche accidents, it is people who start the avalanche themselves, says Palmgren. - That is the vast majority. Off-piste skiing or going on a trip beyond lifts and roads and villages and such. Then it happens from time to time that avalanches sweep into areas that should be safe. The weather right now makes it extremely difficult to assess the danger, even for experienced skiers. - The avalanche danger remains because there are such weaknesses deeper in the snow. So even if it's sunny the following days, it's easy for accidents to happen. It is completely impossible to determine the avalanche danger as a temporary visitor, but also very difficult for us who work with it every day. You should think about that. Petter Palmgren's advice to skiing enthusiasts is to simply accept the situation that prevails. - If you go down and see that there is a big avalanche danger, then it is not a day for off-piste skiing at all. On other days, to lower the risk, you can ride flatter. - You have to lower the risk level because now it is difficult. If you go down to the Alps and follow the facility's advice and such, then you will be very unlucky if you happen to encounter anything. If you still decide to go off-piste, find out where the dangerous areas are and avoid them. - Without that knowledge, it's pure gambling. Most of the time, however, you can do the activities you had in mind, just take it",

At the same time, they tried to convince the International Olympic Committee that Sweden was a safe and secure Olympic alternative. But the attacks created concern and headlines both in Sweden and internationally. - We were concerned, of course. It was something we didn't understand what was happening, says Leif Jennekvist in Jakten på sprengaren, on TV4 Play. Several attacks on sports facilities The first attack occurred in May 1997 when the Nacka ice rink caught fire. This was followed by more fires and explosions, including at Lidingö tennis hall and Stockholm's stadium.  Police initially suspected no connection, but as the attacks continued, a pattern began to emerge. - We had thoughts about who could be behind it, but we had no leads at the time.  A decisive gut feeling The day before the decisive Olympic decision, Jennekvist had a stroke of genius when he saw the Olympic symbol Man and Pegasus on a police colleague's shirt.  He suspected that the next attack would be aimed at Millesgården, where the statue stood. Two plainclothes policemen were dispatched and managed to arrest a man with an explosive charge of 4.3 kilos of dynamite in his backpack. - It was lucky, says Jenneqvist about the arrest.

  "b711313cedd22f3c556821d260fbaccae153baae": "In total, we eat half a million pizzas every day in Sweden. As early as 1947, the Sjöhagen restaurant in Västerås started serving pizza to the 300 guest workers from Italy. Then it took until 1968 before the legendary Bengt Wedholm served pizza at restaurant Östergök and in 1969 the first pizzeria, Pizzeria Piazza Opera, opened its doors in Stockholm. The first frozen pizza was introduced in 1979 and today Sweden is the second best in the world at eating frozen pizza after Norway. The taste panel, consisting of cleaning expert Marléne Eriksson, comedian and actor Isak Löb and food historian Richard Tellström, has tested which is actually the best. They assess appearance, taste and texture. Agree on the bottom line The panel has compared five different Margheritas from five different companies: Lidl, Coop, Ica, Dr Oetker and Tony's. They agreed that Tony's, the only Swedish pizza, was a rock bottom and ended up in fifth place. - This was actually cheese au gratin. A pizza should have melted cheese, but it shouldn't be a hot sandwich, I think. It's not a gratin. It was too much sandwich for me, and no pizza feeling with the tomatoes. It felt a bit pale and half-done, says Richard Tellström. In fourth place was the pizza from Lidl, which Marléne Eriksson only gave two points. - It was very thin. A bit tasteless and way too brittle. It burst when you ate it, says Marlene. The panel disagreed on the rating Ica's pizza grabbed third place, and Isak Löb was very impressed with it - and gave it four plus. - I had to add the plus. It had an incredible tomato flavor. I don't know if they pre-grilled the tomato, but the flavor was the best on it. You can throw in lots of it. I could eat two or three, he says. But Marléne Eriksson disagrees. - There was too much tomato puree taste. It was reminiscent of a sandwich. Not a pizza for me, she says.

In southern Sweden, the day gets about four minutes longer every day, while northern Sweden gets up to eight minutes of change. But the rapid change of light can lead to fatigue.  - There will be a postponement of the circadian rhythm. We get light at the \"wrong\" times because we become dependent on electric light, says Arne Lowden, light and sleep specialist. Spring fatigue despite more light According to Arne Lowden, the fatigue is due to the brain not having time to adjust to stable hormone levels during the sudden increase. - We lack the hormone serotonin, which is needed for us to function, we know this affects animals as well. When the circadian rhythm is disrupted, alertness and mood are affected. Going to bed and getting up at the same times is a way to reduce fatigue.  - One reason why we do well is because we have regular times, but the fact that we need to use an alarm clock is proof that many people have a skewed circadian rhythm, says Arne Lowden. \"A kind of jet lag\" The fatigue during the spring can also be due to other factors.  - The pollen season occurs at the same time and makes us extra tired. We are also activated by light, which means we don't get to bed in time, says Lowden. It is also important to shut out the light completely when the sun rises earlier in the morning. - We don't want sunlight in at the wrong times, that leads to a kind of jet lag in the spring, he says.

In Vasaparken in Stockholm, helmet use is common, but not everyone wears a helmet. Many children go sledding without a helmet, even though the risk of head injuries is high. A survey from Trygg-Hansa shows that four out of ten parents state that their children do not use helmets on sledding slopes. There is no requirement for a helmet, but doctors emphasize that protection can be decisive in the event of an accident. Doctors warn of risks In the event of a strong blow to the head, the brain can shake inside the skull. - What happens is that if you hit your head hard, the brain actually shakes inside the skull or inside the skull. And when that happens, you can get tiny microscopic injuries in the brain. Then you can get the symptoms we call a concussion. In the worst case, it could be that you get an injury to the skull bone, that it breaks. And then you can get a brain haemorrhage, says Viktoria Bove, section manager of emergency medical care for children in Solna.  Children's heads extra exposed Children have larger and heavier heads in relation to the body compared to adults. - This means that they have an increased risk in these situations of getting head injuries of various kinds. It is fantastic to go out with the children and enjoy the snow and ice and everything that we have. But it's actually just as fun to go sledding with a helmet as without a helmet. So put your helmet on, says Viktoria Bove. The children themselves are often aware of the risks. The parent Jeanette Gustafsson questions her son, Nilas Gustafsson. - Do you always wear a helmet? \n- Yes. \n- What does mother say if you don't have a helmet?\n- Go to the ambulance.\n- Yes, then you can go with the ambulance.

  "b6e1bb650d0cbf64d11106358a246320225a164d": "One of the government's central talking points in the policy area of ​​crime and punishment has been the shift in perspective from perpetrator to crime victim.  On International Crime Victims' Day 2023, the Minister of Justice made an attention-grabbing move in which he announced a unified law for crime victims.  But no law is in place, nor does it look like it will become a reality in the foreseeable future. - I'll be honest and say that it has turned out to be quite complicated to achieve it in a really good way. In that case, for the time being, we have chosen to take it from another direction, namely to strengthen the rights concretely in the various parts of the legislation where these rights exist. Instead of a unified law for victims of crime, the government has made a number of efforts to promote the position of victims, points out Gunnar Strömmer. Not top priority Enhanced sentencing is a way for victims to get redress. The government also wants to make it easier for crime victims to get compensation from perpetrators by having the state pay out the money and manage the collection of compensation from the perpetrators. The Crime Victims' Authority has also received targeted funds to shorten the processing time so that crime victims receive their compensation. Anders Alenskär, Director General of the Crime Victims' Authority, believes, as does the government, that a new law is not the highest priority. - For us, it is the rights that are important. Whether they come together in a team or not is not as important. Then there can be both pros and cons. It might be more readily available in a team, but it might be harder to collect it in a team. S skeptical that the law has not been introduced, the Social Democrats, on the other hand, want the law to be introduced. The party only copied the Moderates' model in 2023, but are now skeptical that the government has not introduced the law. - For those who are exposed to crime, the crime itself is only the beginning of a rather upsetting process, where many victims of crime testify to being left quite alone with varying levels of support.

It is a street in the capital Pyongyang with modern apartments for families of soldiers who died in Ukraine, writes The Guardian. North Korean television shows a smiling Kim Jong-un visiting the families with his daughter Kim Ju-ae. Promised to support Putin \"unconditionally\" In recent months, North Korea has increased the amount of propaganda about the war in Ukraine, where \"martyrs\" have been recognized, including through a memorial in Pyongyang. Kim Jong-un has sent thousands of soldiers and large amounts of military equipment to Russia in recent months. Last week he promised to \"unconditionally support\" Vladimir Putin's policies. The South Korean intelligence service believes that the neighbor to the north is profiting from participating in the war in Ukraine. On the one hand, they gain combat experience, but they also receive military technical assistance from Russia. Thousands of dead North Koreans 2024 North Korea sent around 14,000 troops to Ukraine, of whom 6,000 have been killed, according to Western sources. According to The Guardian, North Korea's Communist Party will hold a congress later in February where Kim Jong-un is expected to announce his goals for the next five years. Analysts believe that the opening ceremony on Saeppyol Street is a \"calculated political move\" to be able to send more soldiers to Ukraine, writes The Guardian.",

But they have had their loyal fans with them - now it is clear that they won the most votes in Malmö and go directly to the final. Smash Into Pieces, participating for the third time, have been tipped from the start. The rock group has been clear that the goal is to win and represent Sweden in Eurovision and now they have come one step closer. - We are \"in it to win\", but we need to turn down all mistakes, guitarist Per Bergquist previously told TT with reference to the challenges that arose during the week. Declaration of love Meira Omar grabbed the third place, which means she goes to the final qualification with the entry \"Dooset Daram\". According to her herself, the song is a burning tribute to her husband whom she met in \"Love is blind\". - In this declaration of love, when you talk about something so natural, I want to take it back to natural elements that I think symbolize love.

The incident is considered an accident. Unusually low water levels The wreck in question is a 40 meter long warship from the 17th century and has become visible due to the unusually low water levels of the winter. The ship has not been wrecked but sunk on the spot, which means that it is relatively intact.  In Stockholm earlier in February the water level was 60 centimeters lower compared to normal levels.

The song has received attention both on Swedish television and internationally. The New York Times recently placed it second on its list of the best goal songs, beaten only by a Swiss song. Italian views on the song Italian spectators were asked about their impressions of the song. Several described it as happy and captivating. - Great voices, great acting. Ten out of ten, I think, says Andrea Insom. Another person likes that the 1986 song gives her 70s vibes. - The song is pretty cool, but I only understood the word \"women\" in Italian, says Julia Kamoffo. Lasse Holm happily accepts the compliments, even if his Italian was not entirely easy for the spectators to understand. - The Italians have always stood for good taste and culture. So they have a clue, says Lasse Holm. Proud and honored Lasse Holm tells us that he is proud that the Hockey Association once again chose his music after \"Nu tar vi dem\" from 1989. He looks forward to reliving the goals at home in Sweden. - It has been a great honor and great fun, says Lasse Holm.  Tour plans and future Next up is another season of participating in the Diggiloo tour for Lasse Holm. - Possibly Canelloni will appear this year, perhaps in some context. We are very tight-knit in our group, given the song's revival and its patina, so we are talking about maybe doing something really fun with Canelloni this summer, says Lasse Holm.",

  "7d4a6617fcf11db182af55d17f19275ed0bc6ac6": "At high alert, all mobile users in Sweden can now switch to another network, if their own stops working.  The function has been prepared for two years and can be activated in the event of war, conflict or other serious external situations.  - We call, text and use the internet every day and it is important for the authorities to be able to reach out with information, says Minister of Civil Affairs Erik Slottner (KD). Ove Landberg, strategist at the department for preparedness and security protection, explains that the technology is already used when using your phone abroad. In Sweden, the function is used when calling 112. New tool for high alert The measure covers all four national operators: Telia, Tele2, Telenor and Tre. For users, the service is free of charge, but for security reasons it must be activated manually.  - It is to reduce potential risks if very many phones suddenly have to communicate via another network, says Ove Landberg. If the function is activated, a VMA, important message to the public, is sent out. National roaming is one of several measures used in case of high alert and can be activated quickly.  - When preparedness is heightened, the government has a smorgasbord of different tools to choose from, and then the Post and Telecommunications Board makes the decision. If there is maximum preparedness, the operators activate this in principle immediately. Inspired by Ukraine Erik Slottner believes that the changed world situation has made the issue more relevant.  - We have seen in Ukraine how important it has been to stick together during the war and this is crucial for reaching out with information, he says. In addition to Ukraine, Sweden is one of the few countries that has implemented national roaming, as part of strengthening total defense due to the global situation.  - This is financed through defense investments, there is a special pot for this, says Erik Slottner.  He does not want to speculate whether there are plans for more similar ventures in the future. If a majority of the networks were to be knocked out, other measures are taken.  - Then lie",

Immediately after the detention hearing, the suspect was taken to a clinic for a forensic psychiatric examination. He was there for over a month, until last week, and the doctors' assessment was that the 26-year-old was not seriously mentally ill. TV4 Nyheterna has now taken part of the investigation behind the assessment. Has an interest in death When the 26-year-old arrived at the forensic psychiatric clinic, it was noted that he had an eye injury that occurred around the time of the arrest, which, according to information to TV4 Nyheterna, happened in the act in a forest. The forensic psychiatrists have since mentioned in their statement that the 26-year-old has an interest in \"children and death\" after he tried to kidnap a ten-year-old girl unknown to him in 2019. A large amount of child pornography was also found in his computer. The man has undergone a treatment program for sex offenders after the sentence. After the 26-year-old served his sentence, he and his family were subjected to threats and harassment, he says in the psychological examination. He was therefore given a protected identity and has changed his name several times. In 2023, he changed to a female first name after \"mostly throughout his life he felt more like a woman than a man\". \"Living under the radar\" After his release, he obtained a truck driver's license and started working in the transport industry. He lost several of his jobs. \"In retrospect, (the 26-year-old) has thought about whether the reference to 'lack of work' could be due to other causes,\" the doctors write after talking to him. Later, he managed to get a job that was the \"safest so far\" where he was \"hired without any real background check.\" \"(The 26-year-old) states that he has managed to \"live under the radar, probably due to protected identity information and name changes.\" Leisure interest: Paintball Läk",

At the clinic, both blood tests, ultrasound and X-rays were required before the operation could be carried out, which led to high additional costs. - I felt that they added thing after thing after thing simply so that the final sum would be higher. Why should you do both an X-ray and an ultrasound, there is no reason. How much more expensive was it? - 15-20 thousand more expensive. More want national guidelines According to the Novus survey, which was carried out on behalf of the insurance company Agria, nine out of ten dog and cat owners want open price lists for veterinary care. Agria is also calling for national guidelines for what should be included in various treatments to avoid unnecessary steps and expensive overtreatment. - My feeling from beginning to end is that this was only about money, says Helena Vikström Roslin\nDenies overtreatment Evidensia, where Helena went, says they follow established veterinary guidelines and would never carry out unnecessary treatments to drive up prices.

Clashes with the Basij militia, a volunteer force within the terrorist-branded Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), have been reported. At the same time, the United States continues to build up military strength in the region. On Thursday, the US military reportedly began moving 12 F-22 fighter jets from an air base in Great Britain to the Middle East, according to Israeli media reports based on flight tracking data. US President Donald Trump is said to be considering military options if negotiations with Iran, which are planned this week, fail. It could be \"limited\" military strikes to pressure Iran into an agreement, according to information provided to Axios.  - No one knows what the president chooses, says a high-ranking official in the White House to the newspaper. Eliminate the supreme leader's son According to the information, several options are on the table, including a targeted attack on the supreme leader's son, Mojtaba Khamenei - and also his father. - They have something for every scenario. One scenario takes out the ayatollahs and his son and the mullahs, the official told the newspaper. 55-year-old Mojtaba Khamenei has been singled out as a potential replacement for the supreme leader. Another source told Axios that a plan to kill Khamenei and his son was already presented to Trump several weeks ago. \"The media can continue to speculate on the president's thinking all they want, but only President Trump knows what he may or may not do,\" White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said earlier in a statement. A source familiar with the talks told Axios that both Omani and Qatari mediators have told Iran and the United States in recent days that any deal must allow both sides to claim victory and, if possible, also be something the Gulf states and Israel can live with.

I didn't think I would get to experience that in Sweden, he says in Efter fem. He also points out that Sweden is facing major demographic challenges and that people like Afnan are needed in the country. - It's like saying: gold is a good asset, but we only use gold that is mined in Sweden. It's stupid and inhumane. When racism and incompetence go hand in hand, Sweden runs into the ditch. We need more people like Afnan, not fewer. The change in the law behind the deportation wave The background to Afnan's situation is a change in the law which means that the possibility of a residence permit due to particularly painful circumstances was abolished. The decision was pushed through by the Tidö parties and the Social Democrats. - It is a completely wrong and unfair assessment of such cases, says Afnan Agha. Several high-profile cases have led to political debate and now the opposition, including the Social Democrats, has supported a proposal for a temporary moratorium to freeze deportations while the legal situation is investigated. The proposal will be presented to the Social Security Committee on Thursday, but needs the support of one more party to pass.

It was stated that it was a serious crime, but since then has not wanted to comment anything further. - Unfortunately, our assessment is that we cannot go into what crime we suspect. Due to the confidentiality of the preliminary investigation, it is also not possible to explain in more detail why we cannot go into the classification, says Daniel Wikdahl, press spokesperson at the Stockholm Police. According to information to TV4 Nyheterna, the police were alerted after a little girl came into hospital with injuries. The police started an investigation and suspected that she had been subjected to a serious rape. Information that emerged in the preliminary investigation made the police suspect that the girl was subjected to the sexual crime inside a toilet in the same building as the reception at the asylum accommodation in Märsta, according to sources for TV4 Nyheterna. The site was cordoned off and a technical investigation was carried out. Now, just over two weeks later, still no suspect has been arrested. A prosecutor has been linked to the case and is very secretive. - I will not comment on this case other than that there are no detainees. I will not answer questions in this matter at this time with reference to pre-trial confidentiality and the need to work undisturbed, says Chamber Prosecutor Urszula Grabowska, who leads the investigation. \"The family feels very bad\" The court documents confirm that the classification is aggravated rape against children. The girl's parents have received legal counsel. - The family feels very bad, says the plaintiff's assistant Melissa Toutounge Aksöz to SVT. The Swedish Migration Agency states that security measures have been taken and, among other things, extra guards have been called in. - After the police intervention at the reception and return center in Märsta, we increased the presence of both our own staff and guards on site at the accommodation. This is for the purpose of creating security for the people who live with us. Going forward, the safety and security of our accommodation is paramount",

If you're sick, you're sick, and then you want to unwind and take it easy, but that's not possible, we still have to work. It's about the money. Now the trade union Vision wants to abolish the retirement allowance, an issue that, for example, the trade union Handels has pushed for many years.  Every other member works when ill Vision conducted a member survey where almost every other member works when ill, a third of them because it is too expensive to stay at home. - We see a high level of sickness absence and that people cannot stay at home. It is about quite a lot of money every month if you are sick for one or two days. It is approximately SEK 1,100 if you earn around SEK 30,000, as many of our members do. It can be the difference between being able to buy winter clothes for the children or being able to pay the bills at the end of the month, says Veronica Magnusson, union chairman for Vision. Voted down repealed retirement allowance The retirement allowance has also been discussed in the Riksdag. At the latest in November, the Social Democrats' proposal was voted on in the social insurance committee to scrap the retirement allowance. Johan Britz (L), labor market minister, is one of those who stand behind the retirement allowance. - I think we must constantly continue to discuss the work environment and improve it, not least within the contact profession. But abolishing the retirement allowance would be bad for Sweden, our economy and it would be unfair to those who pull a big load every day, says Johan Britz (L).

By printing clothes and flags with Mandostan's symbols, they managed to get into several parties and events during the Winter Olympics in Milan and Cortina. The idea was born from an old family story. Already in 2006, Corsetti's uncle had managed to trick his way into the Olympics in Turin by pretending to be an athlete from a fictitious country.  - As soon as we heard that the Olympics would take place in Milan and Cortina, we drove there and did the same thing. It was incredible, says Federico Corsetti. Fooled both Boris Becker and Jürgen Klopp The duo says that at first it was difficult to convince people that they were real athletes, but that it got easier each time. They spoke in a made-up language and presented Mandostan as an old Soviet country under the Pamir Mountains in Central Asia. - We had to speak broken English and say: Hi, I'm from Mandostan, says Giancarlo Folonari. With the help of their roles, they managed to trick their way into events where they met famous profiles such as Boris Becker and Jürgen Klopp.  - It was a fantastic feeling. Because we pretended to be athletes, it was like talking to each other as colleagues, says Folonari. Believed to be a terrorist group One of the most memorable moments was when they convinced a Canadian skier that Mandostan really existed - after two hours of talking. However, the adventure almost came to an abrupt end when they put Mandostan's flag on a thirty meter high pole during the Olympics. - It was not a good idea. The fear of terrorist attacks is very high during the Olympics, so they thought it was a terrorist group. But it was just us, says Corsetti.",

Or should, many do.

Spreading the content However, this is not all that viewers will see in the new season, with much of the everyday content being saved for their own channels instead.

When he sat under the bow of the ship, his eyes were fixed - and the fascination. - I was so incredibly impressed by the ship when I sat there, he says. Shortly after the visit, he bought an extensive kit of the Vasaskeppet, unaware that the model was intended for professionals. The work began at home in the garage and quickly became more time-consuming than expected. The guild alone took ten years to complete. - There are no parts that are simply glued together. Each plank must be soaked, bent over a light and shaped. It's a huge job, he says. \"The cowls are wine corks\" When the scythe was finished, he temporarily lost the desire to go on the rig. - There are an awful lot of tampers and threads. So I put it aside for a while, says Micael. Instead, Ullerteg began to manufacture figures and details. It turned out to be everything from sailors and blacksmiths to cows and houses along a self-built quay. - The old men are made of toothpicks and matches. The boxes are wine corks. I have used the foil from a kava bottle for buckets. You have to come up with solutions all the time, he says. In the end, there were so many figures that they couldn't fit on the ship itself. - My wife said it didn't work. Then I built a wharf too. And then there were even more details, says Micael. Fatal accident during Idol night One of the few setbacks occurred when he had the TV on in the background while building. - There was a guy in Idol who sang so terribly fake. I stood up, walked towards the TV and backed right into the ship. The stern went into the floor and became splinters. I had to rebuild everything, he says. Despite extensive work, breaks and Idol accidents, he has never come close to finishing the project. - No, I have never given up. I have only built when I felt like it, instead of sitting in front of the TV. It has always been fun, he says. \"A special feeling\" The last two years were spent on the rig - the part he retired",

  "55d84f5255757283e0c137f3b65399cd1d471e6a": "On Thursday, electricity prices soared in large parts of Sweden. In the south of Sweden, electricity prices rose sharply, with over five kroner per kilowatt hour. The stoppage in one of Sweden's six nuclear power reactors thus comes at a time of already high electricity prices, even if the worst price spikes have subsided now that the cold is releasing its grip on the country. The reactor at Oskarshamn is taken out of operation after an unexpected failure.  - The price will be a little higher, especially in the southern electricity areas. Should it get a bit cold during March, we will continue to be connected to the German electricity prices. We've been doing that for a while now, but it's becoming even more frequent and clearer. We don't get as much cheap electricity from northern Sweden, says Johan Sigvardsson, electricity price analyst at Bixia. Mild weather and wind For many, February's electricity bill will be the biggest for a long time. Meteorologist Ulrika Elvgren gives a forecast for this week's electricity prices and explains how the weather affects it. - The weather has a greater effect than ever. At my house, the electric cartridge has been humming throughout January and half of February, so it will probably be a juicy bill, she says in Nyhetsmorgon. Both temperature and wind affect the price. The temperature controls the consumption and the wind how much wind power you can get out. - What looks favorable in the coming week is that it will be both windier and milder, which will benefit electricity prices by keeping them down a bit, says Ulrika Elvgren. More than half from water Right now the power distribution looks like we get a little more than half of our electricity from hydropower, almost 27 percent from nuclear power and about ten percent from wind power. Wind power will increase now that it will blow more and nuclear power will decrease with the shutdown of the reactor in Oskarshamn. In addition, Formark 3 will enter an audit in March. - You can probably expect that it is above all in southern Sweden that it is more price sensitive. You notice that even during the weekend, although it is quite cheap, it is a bit higher in the south, because of the connection to the continent.",

Despite complaints and several notifications about misleading marketing, Klarna did not end the cooperation with the Dutch company until after Kalla fakta's review.  Right to get money back If a product does not live up to what was promised, you should first of all contact the company you bought from to get a working product or cancel the purchase and get the money back, says Maria Wiezell, consumer advisor at Sweden's Consumers.  - You have the right to that according to the Consumer Purchase Act, she says. If you paid with a credit card or with a service such as Klarna, according to the Consumer Credit Act, you have the right to turn to the credit company if the company does not solve the problem, says Wiezell. - Then the creditor must instead do what the company is obliged to do and ensure that you get the money back.  Important to have proof In order to get the money back, it is important to read about what the product promises. - Unfortunately, the marketing does not always correspond to the reservations that are made in the contract terms themselves. The third step is to turn to the General Complaints Board. Then it is important to have evidence in the form of, for example, screenshots of what the company promised, says Wiezell.  But with some products it is difficult to show that they did not have the promised effect, she adds. - Therefore, in some cases it has been easier to refer to the right of withdrawal.",

Now it has followed these deep low pressures to the north, and when it then rains, the sand can fall from the atmosphere with the rain, says TV4 Nyheternas meteorologist Ulrika Elvgren. The phenomenon when the blown sand combines with rain and falls to the ground is called blood rain. - You can see some reddish drops on, for example, the bonnet of the car. It is most visible if it is raining on top of snow, says Ulrika Elvgren. Moving in during Thursday The rain area is expected to move in over the west coast and a little inland during Thursday afternoon - but it is not entirely certain that the rain of blood will be felt.  - It can rain a little bit over Denmark, so that there are not so many sand particles left when it comes over Sweden, says Maria Svedestig, meteorologist at SMHI. Despite the dramatic name, blood rain is therefore harmless - and not entirely unusual either. It happens once a year and is most common on the west coast.",

Inside the building, the light was red and the alarm box displayed an error code. The emergency button had been pressed and the power to the waterworks that supplies all of Västerås with water had gone out.  Walked in - wasn't locked In the police investigation, it appears that the staff at the waterworks were extremely worried about what happened and that a single person had managed to accomplish the whole thing. They couldn't understand how someone managed to cut off the power and the backup generator at the same time.  \"They see no other way out than that it is a deliberate action to sabotage a socially important activity and that you know exactly what you are doing and what needed to be done to get the desired effect,\" the police write in a memo. The surveillance images show how the man pulled a little on a gate and yanked on a door to get into the power station. In the investigation, it appears that neither the gate nor the door appeared to be locked, nor did the man use any tools.  Mälarenergi, which operates the facility, has previously stated that they will review safety.  Wore a Russian cap and talked about submarines The incident happened on the night of January 30 and the following morning the staff managed to restore everything and get the facility up and running again. That same night, the police were also able to arrest the perpetrator near the waterworks. Then he wore a cap with the Russian coat of arms. He told the police directly that it was he who had been inside the power station.  \"When the patrol drives the man into the station, he states that he has learned several different languages but that\nhe regrets not learning Russian. He also states that he would like to go to Russia and study martial arts,\" the police write in their report.  The officers felt that the man was psychotic and was talking incoherently. On several occasions he talked about there being Russian submarines hiding in the forest. They said he felt disconnected from reality throughout the intervention. The 30-year-old ha",

Symptoms can be headache, blurred vision and neck pain. It occurs, among other things, because we blink less often. - It is important to have the screen at the right height. If you have the screen a little too high, you are forced to stare more and blink too little. You are so interested in focusing on what you are doing that you blink less, says Bo Andersén. Ergonomics and breaks Sitting correctly and ergonomically is therefore part of the solution. - When you are interested, you like to curl up. You should sit ergonomically, with your shoulders back. Like being out riding. Sway in the back and the screen at the right distance, says Bo Andersén in Nyhetsmorgon. Another important point is to take breaks. There is something called the 20-20-20 rule and it means that every 20 minutes you rest your eyes for 20 seconds on something that is 20 feet (about 6 meters) away. The eyes change with age. For problems with dry, itchy eyes, Andersén recommends starting with terminal glasses in time. So-called presbyopia, or presbyopia, usually occurs at the age of 45 and also affects the eyes. - Then maybe an eye examination is even needed. Some struggle up to 55, but then they probably have a bit more headaches and discomfort, says Bo Andersén. With age, the production of lubricant in the glands in the eyes also decreases. Then you may need eye drops. Then you should examine yourself. Another everyday problem is small things that move around in the eye or in the field of vision, so-called vitreous detachment. It is a harmless age-related change in which the eye's jelly detaches from the retina. - It is extremely common. It's a little scary and you get a little worried, but I usually compare it to the skin wrinkling. You can have small figures in the field of vision and the typical thing is that it follows the movements, says Andersén. It is usually nothing serious, but you should have it examined if it comes on suddenly, or if there are large swarms of dots or lines.",

This is what people with insight into the discussions told ABC News. The idea behind the proposal is to avoid the United States appearing as the party that starts a new conflict. Analysts interviewed by ABC News believe the arrangement could also give Republican lawmakers political leeway in an election year, since Trump campaigned on \"ending wars, not starting them.\" At the same time, it is warned that such a strategy risks being perceived as an \"Israel-supported coup\" in the region. \"The media can continue to speculate\" White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly does not want to comment on the information about possible military moves. - The media can continue to speculate about the president's thoughts as much as they want, but only President Trump knows what he will or will not do, says White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly.

In the grocery store, on public transport, at work. And not least in hospitals worldwide.  \n\n- It was a dizzying time. Equipment that was out of date, that was found in some spare warehouse. There were many colleagues from all professional categories who only worked for a few weeks in intensive care. And immediately it was full of patients who were so unbelievably sick, says Ingrid Stubelius, chief intensive care physician at Sahlgrenska University Hospital. Poor preparedness Six years later, Ingrid Stubelius meets TV4 in ICU at Mölndal hospital to talk about her memories of the pandemic. The situation is very different today than it was then. The staff do not have mouth guards and visors on them.  The department is no longer filled to maximum capacity. The patients are no longer young, otherwise healthy people who need ventilators. A calm prevails. The pandemic is over.\n\nBut according to the Medical Association, it is only a matter of time before the next crisis comes and then they do not believe that our preparedness is sufficient.\n\n- Are we well prepared? We are not, I would say. Today, care cannot cope with an ordinary crisis, cannot even cope with an ordinary summer, perhaps cannot even cope with everyday life every time. We need to be honest and say that healthcare is underfunded and we do a lot of things that maybe we shouldn't have to do. And we need to focus more on the core business, says Hanna Kataoka, second vice-chairman, Swedish Medical Association. Care needs to practice Care and care are, together with the education sector, the industries where the largest proportion feel that they often or always have too high a workload.\n\n- Healthcare personnel need to practice preparedness. As it stands today, much is about solving emergency situations. There is no room for training on preparedness, says Hanna Kataoka. \n\nIngrid Stubelius hopes that preparedness is better than it was before covid-19.\n\n- There are so many points where preparedness broke down during the pandemic.

On Thursday, she was questioned for six hours behind closed doors by the House Oversight Committee in Chappaqua, New York, where she and husband Bill Clinton live. In her opening statement, which she published on X before the hearing, Clinton wrote that she does not remember ever meeting Epstein and that she neither traveled on his plane nor visited his home, island or office. She added that, after the crimes became known, she \"like any honest person\" has been outraged by what has come to light about the crimes of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. \"We asked for it\" After the long session, Clinton expressed frustration that the committee chose to hold the hearing behind closed doors. She believed that the process should have been public and that she would have liked to have avoided reproducing the content afterwards. - You could have seen it with your own eyes. We asked for it. It would have been better for the committee and their efforts to gather the information they are looking for, she said.  Demands that Trump testify Hillary Clinton wants Donald Trump to be called to a similar hearing. Democrat Robert Garcia also demands that Trump be heard, but so far the committee's Republican leadership has not taken any initiative in that direction.

  "c7840bf3ff65eccaa03da14782735b242e024455": "It was on the morning of May 13 last year that something went wrong on ATG Casino's website when a security lock was triggered. Suddenly, games could be played without money in the account and customers with zero kroner in the balance could withdraw winnings via Swish.  Word of the bug quickly spread on social media and players rushed to the platform. Now ATG collects money from players in district courts and via the Kronofogden, after the so-called \"bug day\".  - We had a technical problem which meant that customers could withdraw money they were not entitled to. Quite quickly we fixed it, shut down the error, and then we ended up in the situation we are in now, says Jan Sonnevi.  In the last month alone, the company has won or settled over 20 civil cases linked to the incident. - They got several chances to pay. We sent reminders, but in the end we had to send them on to the Norwegian Kronofogdemyndigheten, says Jan Sonnevi, casino manager at ATG.  In total, ATG has upwards of 300 claim cases in court from last year and this year, although it is not confirmed that all of them concern the bug.  Turnover increased fivefold On May 16, ATG sent refunds to players who received winnings paid out without coverage. According to reports that TV4 has seen, the turnover on that day was fivefold compared to a normal day. The same judgments also show that the number of new players was 24 times higher. - They know what they are doing, it is money they are not entitled to, but they try to take it anyway, says Julia Axelsson, contract law lawyer.  Hope for a solution There are still a large number of claims that have not yet gone to court. Exactly when the process is over is difficult to say. - We of course hope that it will be resolved as soon as possible. We have no intention or desire to pursue a process against our customers, we want to move on, so I hope it ends as soon as possible, says Jan Sonnevi.",

  "055268f1f0a1205da2c33cdac1140c928525adff": "Split up the sports holiday weeks - to spread the Stockholmers out in the mountains. That is what Kalle Schröder, who runs a hotel in Lofsdalen, suggests.  - My proposal is to break out parts of those who have sports leave in week nine and let them have it in week seven, eight or ten instead. Schröder believes that today's division leads to higher prices and unnecessary congestion in the ski resorts. However, he sees difficulties in implementing the change.  - It could be a problem for families who have children in different schools or parents who work at the school. \"The Stockholmers come and buffalo around\" Kalle Schröder can imagine that there will be pressure on the ski resorts when all the Stockholmers arrive at the same time.  - Many people from the mountains would probably think that the Stockholmers come and buff around, take up a lot of space, are seen and heard. But there are a lot of lovely Stockholmers too. Magnus Noppa, CEO of the Swedish ski facilities organization, agrees that week nine stands out and welcomes the proposal. He sees that the behavior on the slopes has become more stressed - and that people are less considerate. - I think we see a trend in society as a whole that you come from a stress in everyday life where a lot goes very fast. Then you take it with you when you go on holiday. Has become more expensive According to the comparison service Zmarta, an average ski trip costs SEK 33,000 for a family with two adults and two children in 2026. - The same ski holiday today takes a significantly larger share of the household's finances. Wages have simply not kept up with the lift up to the price peak, says Ola Söderlind, household economist at Zmarta/uScore. Kalle Schröder believes that a change would make sports leave available to more people. The current division is part of a boring social development, according to him.   - It is frustrating. The result is that many friends cannot afford to go and that a large part of the population does not get access to the beauty of nature.",

Almost all reports concern crimes in Stockholm municipality, aimed at plaintiffs who are mainly in their 80s and older, says Maryam Zafaranlou, group manager at the Fraud Section in the Stockholm region, in a press release. The wave of reports meant that the police finally issued a warning message in the SOS Alarms app on Thursday evening. \"Due to the number of reported fraud attempts on the elderly in the Stockholm region, the police would like to urge elderly people to be careful and not let unknown people in at the door\", the police write in the warning and urge the recipient to call 112 in the event of ongoing or recent crimes. \"Close the door if something feels wrong\" Most reports involve a text message in which the fraudsters claim to work for a home care company that will come and clean the home of the person who is contacted. The person is also asked to call a phone number that is in the text message. When this number is called, the victim of a crime can speak to an additional person who will pick up valuables, money or bank cards at the person's home. The police are now urging victims not to call the number in the text message. - We also want to urge the elderly not to let unknown people into the home and to contact the police immediately if they suspect a crime. Close the door if something feels wrong.

Relabeling prohibited Marie-Louise Danielsson-Tham, professor of food hygiene, explains that it is forbidden to change the best-before date on food.\n- It is forbidden to relabel a product with a longer shelf life, she says.\n\nAt the same time, she says that it is not illegal to sell goods where the best before date has passed, as long as it is done with the original label. - In that case, I would recommend that they had sold these with the original markings.

The first thing that usually happens is that they go rancid, explains Danielsson-Tham. She also advises to pay attention to packaging where labels are pasted on top of the original labelling.\n- If you see that something is stuck on a package, then you should be suspicious and ask the store what it is about. Snacks can last for several months According to Danielsson-Tham, it is difficult to say exactly how long snacks such as cheese balls and corn balls last, but they are often edible several months after the best before date if the bag is well sealed. - Months after the best-before date, they should be edible, she says.",

The lawsuit against the state, run with the help of the Center for Justice, continues. 20,000 complaints – every year Ulla-Lena Lindqvist is not alone in being affected by incorrect bookkeeping. The Swedish Tax Agency annually receives around 20,000 complaints from people who have discovered that someone else is registered at their address. - For Ulla-Lena, it is a clear problem that many people subscribe to her address and use her summer cottage as a mailbox for criminals. It is completely unacceptable that it tolerates",

Sida's chief executive officer Hanna Hellquist will be interim director general until further notice. An official replacement will be recruited. Sida tells TV4 Nyheterna that they found out about the news very recently and that they have nothing to comment on. Development Minister Benjamin Dousa's press secretary Jakob Zeiler also does not want to give any comment, other than that the process has gone right. Internal criticism There has long been criticism of Jakob Granit from the authority's employees. According to an employee survey that DN reported on this spring, the staff had low confidence in both him and the management. According to information given to TV4 Nyheterna, there have been differences in Granit's and the board's views on how the authority should be governed. Jakob Granit took office as director general of the Swedish Aid Agency on September 1, 2023. Johansson (S): The government closely controlled Sida in an extremely corrupt way Morgan Johansson, the Social Democrats' foreign policy spokesperson, writes in a comment to TV4 Nyheterna that the resignation is surprising and that he wonders what is behind it. \"It is well known that the government has controlled the authority in detail in an extremely corrupt way, alien to Swedish administrative tradition. For example, the government pushed for the now infamous payments of bribe money to the relatives and acquaintances of the Prime Minister of Somalia.\nAnother noteworthy event is when the government this year demanded that Sida pay out millions of kroner to SD's \"aid organization\" Hepatica, even though their applications did not measure up.  It cannot have been easy to be DG for Sida under those circumstances, and perhaps he has now simply had enough.”",

Canada's Marc Kennedy did not appreciate the Swedish protests and told the Swedes \"fuck off\" repeatedly. Now Kennedy's teammate Ben Hebert says in the podcast \"Big show with Rusic & Rose\" that he also handed out boots to Oskar Eriksson on the ice. \"He's a weasel\" It was lucky my mic was off, let's say that. He had a taste, says Hebert and continues: He is a weasel. He's an unreal player and it's lucky he is, because he's a complete idiot and nobody likes him. But we just brush it off. After the victory over Sweden, Canada went all the way and took Olympic gold. Team Edin, Olympic champion in 2022, finished second last. We weren't going to put up with the bullying and bullshit. We hit them square in the face, that's what we did. We took first place and stood on the podium with the gold medal, says Hebert. \"Rather play clean\" Oskar Eriksson tells TT that he is not very surprised by Hebert's words.  We are fully aware that he is so. He can think what he wants. No one else has said that, but I've only had positive feedback from all the other players who have come forward. I don't know if there is anyone outside of Canada who has supported the Canadian way of being, says Eriksson. Eriksson says that the teams have not spoken to each other after the fight.  There has been no attempt to apologize, but they don't think they've done anything wrong, says Eriksson. I'd much rather play fair and square, and lose or win that way, than break the rules and win. I have won an Olympic gold and now they have too. If they feel proud, they can do it. Marc Kennedy was given a verbal warning by the International Curling Federation after the words.",

And certainly not to detract from it with a tasteless joke.  Trump: \"Must invite the ladies\" After the men's Olympic gold in ice hockey, they were invited to the White House over the phone in the locker room. Then President Donald Trump took the opportunity to make a sour joke. - We will have to invite the women's national team as well, just so you know, said Donald Trump and laughed: - Otherwise I would be impeached. The women's national team declined the invitation, citing logistical reasons and schedule conflicts.

According to TV4 Nyheternas sources, the threat image is to be taken very seriously and described as sharp. A number of Swedish authorities have joined a joint international effort and are actively working on the matter. At the same time, the police around Sweden have received orders to monitor socially critical activities connected to the energy supply, according to the same information. - Police officers on external duty have received sharp calls from the top management to take this seriously and to be vigilant and note all deviations. This is intensive work that is ongoing, says a source to TV4 Nyheterna. The threat actor must have stated a deadline before striking, according to information. It is unknown to TV4 Nyheterna how the attack will be carried out or further details of what the threat consists of. - According to the threat, the actor may strike in the near future, says an informant. The police withdraw the confirmation: \"Following the situation actively\" Swedish police confirmed on Thursday morning that they had received information about a threat to the Nordic energy infrastructure. - We know the data, actively follow the situation and collaborate with relevant actors.

They were going to fish for perch but managed to get a pike on the hook. The fish had gotten the hook in the side and could not therefore be brought up through the hole in the ice. - Then I first thought that we should drill a hole next to the old one. But then Arvid thought it wasn't necessary, we had done that before. Then he ran his hand down there, but the ice was so thick. Just as the hand came down, the pike was there, and then the hook was in the hand, says Johan Bertlid. They were about a kilometer out on the ice and fought for over ten minutes to get Arvid's hand up. Johan's youngest son Bo finally drilled seven holes around Arvid's arm. - So we got the whole lump of ice, Arvid's arm, the bait and the pike, says Johan Bertlid. Still have problems with feeling in the hand In retrospect they can laugh about the incident but in the moment it was panicky. - So hopefully people can learn that you should bring a grappling hook or make bigger holes and absolutely not go out yourself if you have to land the fish in that way, says Johan Bertlid. - He has problems with sensation in his thumb and index finger.

  "f137f013bb779c1adb88dcc59b4ca67be02ad2bf": "The sports holiday week is here - and with it, many families with children are on their way to Sweden's ski resorts. When pressure increases on slopes, restaurants and accommodation, more opportunities are also created for thieves to attack expensive ski equipment. Paul Pintér at Stöldskyddsföreningen believes that the problem is not necessarily that more thefts occur - but that the sports holiday means more opportunities for the thief, something that P4 Gävleborg also previously reported on... - The opportunity makes the thief. The more people moving on the slopes and in the restaurants, the more chances to grab something that is unattended, he says. Simple changes Pintér describes how the behavior of skiers changes when they get to the mountains. Many become less vigilant – precisely because everyone else seems to be too. - There are many people who think \"no one will take my things\". You see jackets hanging everywhere and skis stacked outside the restaurants. But when there are a lot of people on the move, you can get rid of things very quickly. It is easier for a thief to hide in the crowd than when everyone is aware, he says. Expensive gadgets attract thieves Once thieves strike, the target is clear: equipment that can be resold. - Nice, new, expensive skis. Something that has a good resale value. They are the most attractive, says Pintér. Even ski jackets and other equipment can disappear when left unattended in drying rooms, closets or on hooks. The super tip When it comes to actually preventing the skis from being stolen, there's a trick Pintér keeps coming back to - and it stands out precisely because it's so simple. - If you have to leave your skis unattended, tie your skis together with someone else's. The thief wants a complete pair. If they only get a mismatched pair, they can't sell it on, he says. Pintér emphasizes that the trick is not only effective, but also ridiculously simple – so simple that many people don't even think about it. - It's such a simple thing, he says. Paul Pintér also recommends ski enthusiasts to DNA mark their equipment. It did",

It turns out that a man has been shot inside a residence, and another man out on the street. Both suffer life-threatening injuries but survive. A witness captures on film how the shooter fires three shots in the street. Police technicians later find 13 empty shell casings at that location. Dna on scooter The person leaves on an electric scooter and a few hours later the police find a similar scooter in a nearby park. It is immediately suspected that it is the getaway vehicle and two days later the handle is checked for DNA and sent to NFC in Linköping. The police request priority from the NFC, which means that it must be prioritized before other cases. However, priority or emergency right-of-way is not requested, which can be done if it is deemed particularly urgent.  In the case of urgent priority, answers must be provided within ten hours, in the case of priority, answers can be delivered within a few days, according to NFC. It is not possible to say that it is always done in a certain case, but serious violent crimes where there is a hunt for a perpetrator, they are often seen in these foretours, says Thomas Johansson, press spokesperson for the police in the South region. The priority requested is determined after discussion with the pre-trial investigation manager and the local forensic department in the region, he says. Exactly what was the basis for the assessment in the Eslövs case is difficult to answer due to pre-trial confidentiality. We can't always go in with priority right of way, but you have to make careful balances and assessments about what the conditions are and how it affects, says Johansson. But we always want to be able to seize immediately if we had to decide for ourselves. The previously doomed NFC's response from the topping came on May 6, barely three weeks later. The result was a match in the police DNA register on a previously convicted 21-year-old. When it arrived, he had already been arrested for the triple murder. The police in Uppsala were able to identify him with DNA on clothes that were found in a wastebasket after the so-called",

We contact all companies before they end up on the list, so some companies then choose to do the right thing for themselves and pay, says Jonas Ryberg, reporter Råd & Rön. The list is compiled twice a year. On the latest list, there are 388 companies that have ignored ARN's recommendations in a total of 582 cases. - In the update, there are 385 new companies. In total, there are 1065 companies on the list now, it's the first time we've broken the barrier, says Jonas Ryberg. The airlines top the list – as usual The airlines Ryan Air (28) and Turkish Airlines (18), which also topped the list last year, have the most cases, but in reverse order. In third place is the concert organizer Rock Concerts Sweden (11). - Often there are delayed trips and then they have to give compensation according to EU rules, and the airlines don't like these rules so they often ignore them. Why they do it is best answered by themselves, but it is a political position I would say. Because it's not a lot of money, says Ryberg. The company category with the most cases is Motor, where, among other things, the company RM Automobility appears with its eight cases, followed by Bilbolag syd with seven. - Another common industry is tradesmen, and then it's usually about bathroom renovations, solar cell installations and installation of heat pumps, says Jonas Ryberg. You can do that as a consumer If you as a consumer do not get the help you want from a company, you can turn to the General Complaints Board. - That is the first step, hopefully it will be resolved then without having to go to court, which could be the next step. For most people, it might not be worth going to court for a delayed flight unless it's a lot of money. If you still choose to go to court, you can assume that ARN has reviewed your case correctly and that you should",

According to the Public Health Authority, five percent of those who sought care for respiratory infections tested positive in week six of this year. But today no measurements are taken of the entire population and the dark figure is unknown. The typical symptoms such as loss of smell and taste are also not as common. - I think there are those who lose their sense of smell and taste today too. But the symptoms of covid-19 are very difficult to distinguish from a common cold or flu, says Sara Byfors, head of department at the Public Health Agency. When the reports started coming in about a previously unknown virus at the beginning of 2020, Sweden's - and the entire world's - infection control authorities and healthcare were faced with very big challenges. Matti Sällberg, professor and vaccine researcher at Karolinska Institutet remembers when he understood the seriousness of what was about to happen. - It was when Wuhan was shut down. Maybe you can do that in China. But when the same thing happened in New York, then I felt that it was something completely different to what we have experienced before, he says. Fewer seriously ill people Thanks to the rapid development of vaccines and an increasing immunity, the harmful effects of the pandemic could eventually be limited. Today, the risk of becoming seriously ill is much lower. - Fewer people get seriously ill thanks to the vaccines and the fact that many of us have had covid-19 both once and several times. But it is still important that the elderly over 75 and people who belong to risk groups renew their vaccinations, says Sara Byfors. Only a matter of time before a new virus threatens. The virus has also mutated over time and become less dangerous. But that doesn't mean the danger is over.   - It is unlikely that the covid-19 virus would cause a new pandemic.
