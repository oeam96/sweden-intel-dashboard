However, it is clear that the Epstein scandal has now reached Starmer's absolute closeness, which means that other politics end up in the background.\n\nAnyone who follows British politics is used to loud headlines, fierce debates in the House of Commons and frequent ministerial changes. Now, however, everything revolves around the question of what the Prime Minister actually knew when Mandelson was appointed to the prestigious ambassador post in Washington.  In the House of Commons yesterday, Starmer admitted he was aware of Mandelson's contacts with Epstein after the 2008 conviction. But during the pre-appointment security clearance, Mandelson claimed he barely knew Epstein - a lie that led to his sacking over a dawn phone call on the US east coast last September.  Demands for publication In the House of Commons, demands are now growing to publish the documents that show how Mandelson was investigated before his appointment. Starmer supports the demand, but the police - who have opened a preliminary investigation against Mandelson - have stopped publication for the time being. Frustrating for the Prime Minister, to use his own words from today's press conference.  Starmer assures that he had absolutely no information about the close relationship between Mandelson and Epstein that he has today. Perhaps the Prime Minister of Great Britain should ask himself how the security clearance for one of the heaviest assignments in the foreign administration is done?\n\nDocuments from the US Department of Justice, consisting of both emails and photos, testify to close contacts between Epstein and the British heavyweight.  That Mandelson appears in the picture in old white underpants in Epstein's apartment in Paris is in this context a minor detail; significantly more serious is that he shared market-sensitive information and gave Epstein insight behind the scenes into London's political top echelons, including during the coalition negotiations in 2010.",

According to Jakob Hallgren, director of the Foreign Policy Institute, there is a great risk that a long period of disarmament will now stop – or reverse. - This is the first time since the early 1970s that there is no agreement regulating the number and use of the most powerful nuclear weapons between the two countries that have the most in the entire world, he says. Regulated the most dangerous weapons The agreement that is now expiring has been about limiting strategic nuclear weapons, above all intercontinental missiles that can be fired from the US at Russia - or vice versa. In recent decades, these agreements have led to a sharp reduction in the world's nuclear arsenals. - During these 50 years, they have gone from a maximum of 70,000 nuclear weapons down to 12,000 today. It is a result of successive reductions that are now stopping – or, in the worst case, reversing. According to Hallgren, the risks already exist today. One of the biggest problems is that the US and Russia can no longer agree on new agreements. Today, China is estimated to have around 600 nuclear weapons, but Hallgren points to information which claims that the country may be on its way to 1,000 or 1,500. - China is now the factor that makes it impossible to come to an agreement. The US has said it wants China on board, but the Chinese say no. Increased tensions - also in Europe When there is no agreement that regulates the most devastating nuclear weapons, tensions in the outside world also increase, says Hallgren. The expert emphasizes that even a limited use of nuclear weapons would have extreme consequences. - Even the smallest nuclear weapon would have completely devastating effects, with hundreds of thousands - if not millions - of people injured or killed. There are terrible effects of nuclear weapons. At the same time, there is still the so-called non-proliferation agreement, which came into force at the end of the 1960s and aims",

But the funding itself must still come from the countries' own, often already strained budgets. From Berlin to Dresden by high-speed train In the south of Berlin, a new railway line shines in the sun. Double tracks, high noise barriers and a nail-straight stretch to the south. It is Germany's newest high-speed line, which opened at the beginning of December 2025 and makes the journey between Berlin and Dresden ten minutes faster. The project took 20 years to plan and seven years to build – but without any delays. The next step is to extend the route to the Czech capital Prague. Then the travel time between Berlin and Prague will be reduced to two and a half hours, compared to almost five hours today. Such a project is exactly what the European Commission wants the member states to invest in. Underinvestment, cheap tickets and short-term thinking But according to Christian Böttger, it will take years before a similar project can be inaugurated in Germany – or in Europe as a whole. According to him, billions are missing to even renovate the existing railway. The funds that do exist are often used for short-term solutions or for politically popular measures, such as lowering the price of train tickets. In Germany, years of underinvestment are clearly visible. Only about 62 percent of the trains run on time. Sweden is average within the EU, but still manages better, with around 87 percent on time. - In such a situation, to believe that new high-speed lines will be built within 15 years is wishful thinking, he says.",

  "d39132ccb5849bd8b9e5720520d6590fbfc7245e": "Thursday evening and Friday can be messy in parts of Skåne. Previously, an orange warning for snowfall combined with wind has been issued for south-eastern Skåne, and in the southern and central parts of the county a yellow warning has been issued for similar weather conditions. The warnings apply from five o'clock on Thursday afternoon and extend until two o'clock on Friday afternoon. - In the south-eastern parts, there may be upwards of 20 centimeters of snow, locally more. There will also be a fresh to strong easterly wind - and then you know there will be snowdrifts in Österlen, says TV4 Nyhetern's meteorologist Peter Kondrup. \"Bare ground to half a meter of snow in no time\" Drift formation is a recurring problem in the open landscapes of Scania. Despite a snowfall of around 20 centimetres, the snow depth can vary significantly, which can affect both major and minor roads. - If you've ever been to Skåne, you know that it can go from bare ground to half a meter of snow in no time. There is nothing to stop the snow, but it drifts from one place to another and unfortunately often accumulates on the road. The advice is not to go out in traffic if you really don't have to, says Peter Kondrup. The last time there was an orange warning in approximately the same area in south-eastern Scania, a large part of the forecast was missed. - There were not as large quantities as feared and therefore there were not as many problems as had been expected. However, it remains to be seen how it will turn out this time – forecasts are forecasts, says Peter Kondrup. Risk of ice slippage Along the Öresund coast in the west, mild air will move in from the south, which can lead to freezing rain and ice slippage. - So it can be really noisy in Skåne tomorrow, with drifting snow in Österlen and risk of icy conditions in the west. In addition to Skåne, SMHI has issued a yellow warning for snowfall in parts of Halland and Västra Götaland counties. The warning applies from six o'clock on Friday morning and extends from just north of Varberg up to Trollhättan. During Friday, the weather moves north and in the West",

  "bb1fe796044e846e372c041cee147d3ccd82b4ec": "The National Board of Health and Welfare has gone through 98 cases where children and adults in the years 2019 to 2024 have been killed or subjected to serious violence. Among these there are 41 cases involving children and in half of those cases it is the child's own parent who exposed them to the violence. Is it a failure? - You have to say that. When we have gone through these 98 cases, they are cases that have fallen between society's safety nets and then suffered fatal violence, have been murdered or serious violence, says Björn Eriksson in Nyhetsmorgon. Difficult to put together the puzzle The survey adds to previous reports on intimate partner violence to identify where society is failing. - We know what the risk factors are. Often there has been contact with the health and medical services. The police have been aware of them and social services have been aware. But it has been difficult to piece together this complex picture as it has been. That is what has broken, says Björn Eriksson. The National Board of Health and Welfare points out that these are unusual, but very serious crimes. - The vast majority of parents do not harm their children and the vast majority of women are not killed by a partner. But every case is so serious. We have an obligation to better prevent, says Moa Mannheimer, licensed psychologist and investigator at the National Board of Health and Welfare. Must listen more to the children The authority has several proposals for measures that must be presented to the government. An important part is more collaboration. - We can see in retrospect that the police had certain duties, the social service had certain duties and the health care service others. But putting the puzzle together and assessing risks in a structured way - that has been missing in these cases, says Moa Mannheimer. Another measure identified is that the child's situation must be strengthened. - You need to listen more to the children's voice both within healthcare, the police and social services. We need to take steps forward and not always just listen to the parents' version, but also take in the whole, says Björn Eriksson.",

  "ac38a9d07d9b6a5d78a4425981f9df7e21faf9be": "A week and a half ago, Djurens vänner in Staffanstorp in Scania received an emergency call from a family who could no longer care for the 30 guinea pigs they had at the time. Actually, the animal shelter did not have room for more animals, but still chose to move in. - We still felt that the situation was so big. The family really needed help, says Linnéa Stålhandske, operational director of Friends of the Animals Skåne.  More guinea pigs than expected When the animal friends arrived at the family in Staffanstorp, they were greeted by more animals than expected – 40 guinea pigs and a turtle. Guinea pigs become fertile as early as three to four weeks of age, which means they can reproduce quickly if kept together.  - Then they often mate with those nearby. If it is then a mother or a sister, it will be inbreeding. To avoid further reproduction, all males have now been neutered. When the guinea pigs were taken into care, fur and claws were left behind. Among the guinea pigs was \"Grandma Rosiepuff\", the oldest guinea pig who is believed to be the mother of many of the others. - She is probably related to all of them. She is the oldest guinea pig we have received, says Linnéa Stålhandske in Nyhetsmorgon.  \"Looking for the perfect homes\" After the case drew attention in social media, the animal shelter has received many expressions of interest. At the same time, care is taken to only place the guinea pig with serious animal owners.  - We do not sell small animals to be kept in cages. We do not sell small animals to be toys for children, of course. So we look for the perfect homes.  Guinea pigs can live between five and ten years if cared for properly. They need large areas to move around, such as a paddock or their own room, and should never be kept alone. They require companionship, a proper diet of fresh vegetables and free access to hay.",

She makes bonnets, jewelery and art objects from reindeer antler, leather and wood for Jokkmokk's market. Despite the fact that e-commerce has grown in importance, the market is still the most important sales opportunity of the year for many Sami artisans. Combining crafts and reindeer herding Julia and many other Sami craftsmen combine crafting with reindeer herding. During the winter, spring and summer, reindeer husbandry takes up most of the time, while autumn is devoted to handicrafts. The work is long-term and already in the spring of the year before, planning begins for next year's market. - Yes, for me it is like that, at the market you sell for the whole year. After all, the market is the target, because it is precisely Sami craftsmanship that you want to see, look at and feel. So you prefer to buy on the spot, it's not something you just order. But you want to see what you get, says Julia Rensberg. Long-term planning for the future The materials, reindeer antler, hide and wood, for the craft often have to dry for one to two years in order not to crack and break during the crafting itself, which requires careful planning. Julia Rensberg emphasizes the importance of being careful with both materials and resources to secure the opportunities of future generations. - The material should ideally dry for one to two years, so this spring I started thinking about the market that will come in 2027. It takes time and you have to be careful both with materials and resources and think far ahead and also make sure that there is material left for future generations, says Julia Rensberg.",

Police in Arizona suspect she has been abducted from her home outside of Tucson and are investigating the incident as a crime. Nancy Guthrie was last seen late Saturday night, January 31, when she returned home to her residence. When she didn't show up at church the following morning, friends and family raised the alarm, and she was reported missing at lunchtime on Sunday. Demanding ransom US media have reported signs of a break-in and traces of blood in the home. However, authorities have been tight-lipped on details and have not publicly confirmed exactly what was found, citing the ongoing investigation. The incident has gained further attention after several media outlets, including TMZ, reported receiving messages demanding a ransom for Nancy Guthrie's release.  The police have not yet confirmed that the claims come from an actual perpetrator – but have not dismissed them either. \"When messages come to us, we treat it like any evidence,\" Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told CBS News. The family's plea Four days after the disappearance, Savannah Guthrie, along with her siblings, posted a video on Instagram in which they directly address the person who may be holding their mother captive. - We are ready to talk. But we live in a world where voices and images can be easily manipulated. We have to be absolutely sure she's alive. And that you have her. We want to hear from you, and we are ready to listen, she says.  She also tells us that her mother lives with constant pain and depends on her medicine to survive.  - Everyone is looking for you, mother, everywhere. We will not rest. Your children will not rest until we are together again, she says.

The government believes that this has led to people convicted of rape in some cases having to stay in Sweden. The government wants rape and other serious sexual crimes to always be considered extremely serious crimes when considering deportation. - Rapists must be able to be deported. It doesn't get any weirder than that, says Migration Minister Johan Forssell (M) to TV4 Nyheterna. Wants to get other countries on board According to Forssell, Sweden is the first to come out with the initiative, but the government hopes to get other countries on board, mainly within the EU and the Nordics. The work is now starting at the UN level and the process may be long, even if movement is hoped for already this year. - Sweden will soon have the toughest regulations in the Nordics for criminal deportations, but it is not enough. We also want to change the international framework, says Forssell. In parallel, the government is expected to present new Swedish legislation this spring, which could lead to more criminal deportations. The individual examination in court must remain, but the government wants rape to always weigh very heavily in the assessment. Dismisses symbolic politics The background is that Swedish courts, with reference to current practice and international conventions, in some cases judged that the crime was not serious enough for deportation. The government therefore wants to influence how the refugee convention is applied, including through changes in UNHCR's governing documents. Forssell dismisses the initiative as symbolic politics, but admits that the process can be both difficult and time-consuming. - This is work that has not been touched on for a very long time, he says.",

This is shown in a research report from AgriFood Economics, which is a collaboration between the Swedish University of Agriculture and Lund University. If the dietary change persists, it can make us sicker. \n\n- The fact that we reduce the intake of fruit and vegetables and also dietary fibre, has had a negative effect on public health. Above all, cardiovascular diseases could increase if we continued to eat this way over time, says Jonas Nordström, who is associate professor of economics and one of the report's authors.  Does not buy fresh fish Eva Ahlgren from Malmö shops with her husband and grandchildren at Ica Mathuset in Åkarp, Scania. She notes that they never bought very much fruit and vegetables, because the husband is not that fond of vegetables, but they buy less fish today than before the price increases.\n\n- Maybe frozen fish in that case. Fresh is very expensive, she says. \n\nLars Håhus, who is a regular customer in the store, belongs to those who have not changed their purchasing habits at all in recent years.\n\n- I'm as stingy as I've always been and buy what I want and what's the best price, he says with a smile.  Hitting low-income earners Jonas Nordström and his research colleagues at AgriFood Economics could also see that it was the cheapest goods that received the highest percentage price increases. A phenomenon known as \"cheapflation\".\n\n- It is often households with fairly small margins who choose the cheap products. In this way, it can be said that cheapflation and the inflation we have had have affected low-income households to a greater extent, notes Jonas Nordström.

This also applies to parts of the plot that belong to Bengt's hotel. - I thought: What on earth? It wasn't destroyed yesterday, but it happened this morning. I've never seen anything like it. - And it continues to blow. So it's great weather. Bengt Lundblad and the family also celebrated his 74th birthday at the same place. - Then we had sunshine and there were sunbeds and laps of sun. So there are tremendous contrasts. \"People stay inside\" When asked what the atmosphere is like in the village, the birthday boy replies that he doesn't know. - There aren't that many people out, so we don't meet that many. They stay inside, people down here. After all, they also warned us - we shouldn't go out, they said. But Bengt Lundblad does not feel particularly worried about himself. - We have a good hotel that stands firm, he says and continues: - You have to stay away from the sea. Now we are actually sitting in a restaurant by the sea. But it's on solid ground so it won't fall down. On Friday, the storm will subside and Bengt Lundblad and his family will remain in Calahonda next week as well. - So we hope for a few sunny days.",

The talks were confirmed by both sides late Wednesday after some uncertainty about the time and place. Focus on the nuclear program The US delegation wants to investigate \"zero nuclear weapons capability\" for Iran, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, who emphasizes that Trump has \"many options at his disposal beyond diplomacy\", reports AFP. The talks come shortly after widespread protests in Iran, where human rights groups report tens of thousands dead after heavy crackdowns.\n\n- They are negotiating, Trump says of Iran.\n\n- They don't want us to attack them, we have a large fleet heading there, he adds, referring to the group of aircraft carriers he called an \"armada\".\n\nVice President JD Vance says Trump \"will talk to everybody, he will try to accomplish what he can through non-military means and if he feels the military is the only option, he will ultimately choose it.\" Regional concerns and diplomatic hopes German Chancellor Friedrich Merz calls on Iran's leadership to \"really start talks\" and warns of \"great fear of military escalation in the region\". Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says that \"the parties want to give room for diplomacy\" and that conflict \"was not the solution\".\n\nAccording to the New York Times, the US has agreed to exclude regional actors from the talks, but missile and militia issues can still be discussed.  The Institute for the Study of War states that \"Iran continues to show inflexibility in meeting US demands, reducing the likelihood that Iran and the US will be able to reach a diplomatic solution\".\n\nIran has warned to strike back against US bases if attacked. \n\n- We are ready to defend ourselves and it is the President of the United States who must choose between compromise or war, said General Mohammad Akraminia.",

  "929f7723a7490779b6801a57d839f22b8a0f66d7": "It was a couple of years ago that Dumpen confronted a man who they believed had sex-chatted with a 14-year-old. After being hanged, the man stated that he felt unwell and was unable to work, which led him to sue Dumpen's responsible publisher for gross defamation. - This one is perhaps particularly interesting because Dumpen is very much noticed in society. It poses very big questions at its tip that arouse a lot of emotions, says Ängla Pändel, lawyer and expert on defamation issues. \"Quite unique for Sweden\" According to a jury, which is used in this type of case, she is guilty. But now the judge must also take a position on the issue and announce the verdict today. In this case, Dumpen can be convicted of defamation regardless of whether the man was guilty of the sex chats or not. - It is quite unique for Sweden that the defamation provision also covers information that is true. But on the other hand, you carry out a type of justifiability assessment, so in some cases it can still be justifiable to spread this type of information if you can show that the public interest outweighs the individual's right to privacy and protection of personal integrity, explains Ängla Pändel.",

He has also served as secretary general of the Council of Europe and as chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee.  Now Norway's ecocrime authority has decided to investigate him, following suspicions that he was guilty of ecocrime in his contacts with Jeffrey Epstein. - We have decided to start an investigation against Thorbjørn Jagland, says Pål K. Lønseth, head of the Norwegian Ecocrime Authority, to NRK. More specifically, they are investigating whether Jagland received gifts, trips and loans while he was chairman of the Nobel Committee and secretary general of the Council of Europe. Want to waive immunity There is, however, an aggravating circumstance. Jagland has immunity for his former role in the Council of Europe. The ecocrime authority now wants the Norwegian Foreign Ministry to lift that immunity, reports Dagbladet. \"Because Jagland has immunity as the former head of an international organization, Ekokrim has asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to take the initiative to lift the immunity,\" the authority writes in a press release. Norway's Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide agrees with the Ecocrime Authority that Jagland's immunity must be lifted. - It is important that this issue is clarified. Then Jagland's immunity cannot stand in the way of an investigation. I have therefore decided that Norway should present a proposal to the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers that Jagland's immunity should be lifted, says the foreign minister. Taking the investigation in stride Thorbjørn Jagland's defense lawyer, Anders Brosveet, however, takes the accusations against his client in stride. He tells VG that they will cooperate with the investigation and submit the requested documentation. - And based on what we have found, we are calmly looking at the outcome. It is first and foremost good for Jagland to get an authoritative clarification from Ekokrim, rather than the entire press corps carrying out its own little private investigation, says Brosveet.  Emails in the latest Epstein files show, among other things",

  "720d18b9711156d13bfeba8e583fd3d856114b87": "According to an American study, one in four singles in the United States, and almost half of Generation Z, use AI to, among other things, analyze messages when dating online. One of those who use AI as a springboard in their dating is Dilara Chakali. - When I went to therapy, I felt: One hour a week was not enough for me. I wanted to reflect more. I wanted to understand myself more, how I function in dating, says Dilara Chakali in Efter fem. \"Not so strange\" Dilara Chakali says that she uses AI to get straight answers, but emphasizes that it is she herself who decides which advice she takes to heart. - I want \"the ugly truth\", she says.  - Then of course I choose how I act on it. I want to believe that I have the self-awareness that I don't act on everything it says, she says. Psychologist Maria Farm believes that it is a natural human behavior to ask for advice. And in this way, it is understandable that more and more people are using AI in these matters. - I think it is a natural consequence. That it is there and that we also use it in psychological matters, I don't think that is so strange in itself, says Maria Farm in Efter fem. The psychologist's advice: See it as a supplement Farm sees no major problems with using AI as support, but urges you to ask yourself the question for what purpose you are asking a question, as it can become destructive in the long run if you constantly have to ask and cannot make decisions yourself. - I have many clients who are a bit anxious, full of anxiety and they sometimes need to practice not actually asking so many questions about it, it could be the relationship, but it could also be their own health.  - With me, they get to practice standing up for their own opinion or maybe not asking for completely certain answers all the time, adds Farm. Maria Farm recommends that AI be used as part of a larger palette when it comes to big decisions in life. - If you are thinking about something as big as divorce, also ask a person. It doesn't have to be a therapist, but some wise person you trust",

  "a9cff08032cb77552a536a8a010fcb00023732c4": "Since the middle of January, a high pressure has settled over Sweden. Especially high pressure and freezing temperatures go hand in hand during the winter months, not least when it becomes prolonged.  In meteorology, such a locked-in high pressure is called a high-pressure blockage, and is what lays the foundation for weather extremes. - Blocking high pressure creates winter's cold snaps and summer's heat waves, explains TV4 meteorologist Ulrika Elvgren. Therefore the cold remains The reason why the high pressure has become permanent is partly that it consists of slowly sinking air, that is to say that it receives its air supply from above. The cold air is also heavier than the warm, and air accumulation (high pressure) therefore thrives in the atmosphere closest to the ground. In order to break the high-pressure bucket, an extensive low pressure with a substantial portion of mild air is therefore required.  But during periods of high pressure blocking, the low pressure is instead guided around the high pressure and the cold, as now, is allowed to remain undisturbed.  - It's a locked-in weather situation and we've had this high pressure now for several weeks, but it might start to weaken a little during the next week and let in a little more weakened frontal zones, says Ulrika Elvgren. - We have already received a little more snow in southern Sweden. But it looks like the cold air won't let go. A cold domain lies over the whole of northern Europe and into the Russian continent and further east, she adds. \"No clear mild air coming in\" Although the high pressure may change at the beginning of next week, one should not count on the cold air to disappear because of it. Further ahead, the forecasts are too uncertain to be able to draw any conclusions. - It looks like colder air will return as we approach the middle of February. We have no clear mild air coming in. Maybe sometime in the second half, towards the end of February. But the first half of February still looks very cold, says Ulrika Elvgren. - There is no hope of any spring heat before Valentine's Day. From February 15 starts",

The Jas Gripen is a far better and more cost-effective alternative, it is believed.  The proposal by Saab to sell the Jas Gripen to Canada should be adopted immediately, Opposition Leader Davies said at a press briefing in the Canadian Parliament in Ottawa last night, underlining that the situation is serious. Reduced dependence on the United States The play is done against the background of Canada's decision to expand its air combat forces with 88 new planes. 16 of these, F-35 Lightning from American Lockheed Martin are already booked and ordered. But there is now an intense debate about the remaining 72 combat aircraft; which plan to choose? Concerns about the reliability of the United States as a partner have grown in Canada following Donald Trump's repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state of the United States. The opposition now also points out that Prime Minister Mark Carney himself in his famous speech in Davos recently emphasized that Canada must act more independently and reduce its dependence on the United States and invest more in cooperation with medium-sized countries. \n\n- If Mark Carney completes the purchase of the F-35, it proves that his statements in Davos were just a PR stunt, says Don Davies.

We would see it as a hub for exports, said Mikael Franzén, head of marketing for Saab's Gripen program at the Singapore Airshow yesterday.

In connection with the visit, Åkesson had planned to participate in the traditional reindeer race, but the SD leader needed to think again. According to information to TV4 Nyheterna, Åkesson skips the competition at the request of Säpo. \"Heard it was a revolver\" Several politicians on site have been informed of an \"incident\" by the authority. The party leader tells TV4 Nyheterna that he learned that someone dropped a weapon-like object near him. - I heard that it was a revolver or a pistol, says Jimmie Åkesson. The police write on their website that they have information about a weapon-like object, but that it must have been picked up and that one or more people must have left the scene. The police have not yet found any weapon. At first there were reports that politicians had been threatened, but the police deny this. Säpo denies Säpo's press service does not want to go into whether they warned the SD leader about a firearm. - Our dialogue with our guardians is not something we can go into, so I cannot say anything about it. It is part of the protection itself, says Säpo's spokesperson Johan Wikström. The Sweden Democrats' press department cannot confirm whether Åkesson has received threats. - The information I have is that he is not running, and it is after a recommendation from Säpo, says party spokesperson Emma Kareld. It is not the first time Jimmie Åkesson has had to leave Jokkmokk's market. In 2014, his book signing at the market was stopped due to threats, which SVT Norrbotten reported on at the time.",

Zdolsek is nominated for a feature on the increased violence and harassment against Palestinians by extreme settlers in the West Bank, and Åkerman is nominated for a feature on New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani. Both features are made with reporter Filip Jacobsson. - It is an honor, but it is Filip who should have the credit for the idea for the feature, says Petter Åkerman. Celebrating the aesthetic quality Daniel Zdolsek also highlights reporter Filip Jacobsson. - The fact that we are nominated says something about the fact that we have reporters who care about the aesthetic expression and quality, and that we have been seen so much in recent years. It says something about where the channel stands in terms of quality compared to the competitors - I think we are far ahead of everyone else. It's fun, says Daniel Zdolsek and adds: - TV4 allows you to develop and express yourself aesthetically and visually qualitatively during the work shifts, which I value.",
